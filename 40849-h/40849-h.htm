<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>These essays originally appeared in <i>The
Musical Standard</i>, for which paper they were
written.</p>

<p>While admitting that the author has at times
been carried away by his exuberant fancy, it is
impossible to deny that he possesses in a very
high degree those powers of analysis without
which it is impossible to do justice to, or even
approximately to understand, Beethoven. Music
is verily the language of the soul&mdash;higher,
finer, more delicate in its methods, and more
ethereal in its results, than anything to which
the tongue can give utterance; expressing what
speech cannot speak, and affecting, as no mere
talking can, the invisible player who manipulates
the keyboard of the human intellect, and
whom we call <i>The Soul</i>. Music is truly of
such a nature, and appeals so powerfully and
mysteriously to that soul, that the words of
Jean Paul seem quite justified,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ich glaube, nur Gott versteht unser Musik.</i></p>

<p>Beethoven wrote such music as few even among
those calling themselves musicians can understand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
as the word is generally used; and
which, in Jean Paul's sense of the word, is understood
not at all. Like the ocean, or Mont
Blanc, we can feel its power, while at the same
time we are conscious that explanation would
be almost desecration. We do not want Beethoven's
music explained, but would rather be
left alone with that which we can only feel, but
cannot understand while hampered with "this
mortal coil." Under the spell of such music,
we can only explain the emotions it produces in
us, and we can only do this in a fashion far
from complete. Mr. Teetgen has only attempted
an explanation of Beethoven's symphonies
in this latter sense; and so far from
feeling his little book as an impertinence&mdash;which
any attempt to explain Beethoven's
music (his soul, <i>id est</i>) would be&mdash;we feel
helped in our endeavours to understand something
of the means by which the greatest tone-poet
worked his incantations and wove his
spells.</p>

<p>We cannot always agree with Mr. Teetgen in
his estimate of other composers&mdash;notably, Mendelssohn,
whom he holds in much lighter esteem
than we do, and we could not endorse all
he says of Mozart, either; he does not worship
his great hero too much, but the others too
little. Of his most intense admiration for
Beethoven, however, none can doubt; and those
who read this little work will, we think, agree
with us in saying that Mr. Teetgen's analytical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
and descriptive powers, in dealing with the
symphonies, are on a par with his veneration
for the great master whom we all delight to
honour, and who realised his own ideal&mdash;some
of us, at least, think so&mdash;"There is nothing
higher than this&mdash;to get nearer the Godhead
than other men, and thence diffuse its beams
over mankind." Fashions change in music as
in other things; but Beethoven's music has in
it that truth which, being eternal, cannot
change; and we cannot conceive a state of culture
so advanced that these Symphonies shall
be deemed old-fashioned. If ever that condition
is reached, it will be reached not by progression,
but retrogression.</p>

<h2>BEETHOVEN'S SYMPHONIES CRITICALLY<br />
AND SYMPATHETICALLY DISCUSSED</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
<img class="figleft" src="images/deco_t.jpg" width="60" height="71" alt="T" />
HERE are some words of such indefinite
pregnancy that they expand the soul when
we pronounce them. The highest of these
I do not name; but "love" is one,
"spirit" another, "immortality" another,
and "symphony" another. We suppose, the first symphony
was when "the morning stars shouted together
for joy;" and the mystic world-tree, Igdrasil, with its
"leaves of human existence," and myriad manifestations,
maketh a symphony for ever in the ear of the
Eternal. As music is sound, so perhaps all sound is
music, to a higher being&mdash;even the discord of pain,
and the half cadence of sorrow being justified by a
soul of meaning; just as music proper, itself would
not be half so sweet or complete without its profound
minors and expressive dissonances. The world is full
of music&mdash;from the "tiny-trumpeting gnat" and the
forest-buzz of summer, the happy murmur of the sea
on its mother's breast, and the equally happy hum of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
the bee in the waxen cup, to the scream of the eagle
and the roar of the lion, the thunder of the breakers
and of heaven's artillery. Every one has observed
how the very creak of a door may sometimes rise
into music. And the whole world goeth up in
music, swelling the symphony of the spheres. But,
from these ground tones&mdash;these universal hints to
their human expression and counterpart in the
"father of all such as handle the harp and organ,"
was a long, long way. Nature waited to produce her
mouthpiece, Man, to manifest herself forth in that
prolongation of herself which we call <i>human</i> nature.
Then the vague sublimity of unfettered sound became
incorporated in tone&mdash;became conscious&mdash;and spoke
more humanly to the soul of man. At length, after
a whole history of evolution, the pride of modern
times&mdash;modern music&mdash;appeared; and in due course,
after a tottering infancy and empiric youth, the modern
symphony. As in every case, the outcome is
the result of an endless series of gradations; for, if
nature abhors a vacuum, she at least equally abhors
drawing a line, and taking a jump. Therefore, if we
denominate brave old Haydn as the father or founder
of the modern symphony, it is for happy convenience
sake, and not because strictly accurate. Always there
were Agamemnons before Agamemnon; and Haydn
borrowed and imitated like everybody who is first
student and then master (in his old age, <i>sogar</i>, he
learnt of and benefitted by Mozart). Cursorily we
may mention as kinds of forerunners Bach's "Suites,"
such a piece as Purcell's prelude to "King Arthur"
(what a prelude would such a subject demand now!
Milton, too, thought of poemizing King Arthur); and
Handel's "Pastoral Symphony," which so beautifully
and for ever corroborates old King George's remark
(which we suspect he stole). The value of no word
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
is known till the greatest master of it has arrived.
This is strikingly illustrated by a Handel symphony,
and a Beethoven. It is the latter which expands the
better part of us in the way spoken of at the outset.
The unconscious men of Handel's time used it in
little more than the sense of a strain; and here it
may be remarked that progress is impossible without
consciousness, but that&mdash;wheel within wheel&mdash;the
higher consciousness will always have a soul of unconsciousness.
The two are <i>sine quâ non</i>. Conservatism
and convention are the eternal necessary
protests and counterpoises to chaos; and <i>every</i> man
has his <i>roots</i> in his time (and in the past); therefore
we are not surprised that Haydn constructed his
symphonies in the mode and spirit of that day&mdash;especially
retaining the minuet&mdash;which Beethoven
himself only later discarded for the scherzo. Moreover,
a moment's reflection will show us that the form
of a symphony, as of a sonata, is naturally dictated,
of inner necessity, by the simple need of natural
contrast. An adagio may well open the piece&mdash;so
may an allegro; but then we certainly want an
andante, or largo; scherzo, or minuet, are next expected;
and a presto to wind up&mdash;for art also is
dependent on flesh and blood; and the human body,
as well as mind, dictates many of art's proceedings.
The form, then, of the symphony was, we may
say, on the whole, dictated, from the beginning
of things. Nobody can particularly claim to be its
inventor; "nature, even in art, has ever the greatest
share." If Haydn could really claim to be the
inventor of the symphony, he would be a far more
original genius than he is ever believed to be&mdash;though
probably we do really underrate his originality, a fate
which inevitably overtakes all such men. If we
leave the form, then, and consider the spirit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Haydn's symphonies, it is, shortly, the spirit of eternal
youth; just as one could apply to Mozart Gilfillan's
appellation of Shelley, "the eternal child."
We get a negative idea of Haydn if we reflect how
infinitely removed from Hamlet! (Beethoven, on the
contrary, how allied!&mdash;a German Hamlet). I do
not believe that Haydn, any more than the other
two of that glorious Orion's belt, was a "good Catholic."
I imagine, all three had a proclivity rather
to natural than revealed religion; and I believe that
we may compass and understand, in a manner, that
marvellous outburst of South German music, with all
its freedom and glow, by considering it as Roman
Catholic without Roman Catholicism; one feels and
sees rather the eternal truth and poetry of nature
than the warped narrow spirit and practice, and garish
glare, of papal dogma, priest-presided slavery, and
superstition. But, to quit these impossible difficulties,
the music of all three is stamped by one
grand common characteristic&mdash;it is German. When
to nationality we add individuality, we are more or
less near to a tolerable understanding of it. Race is
mixed in every man&mdash;who can resolve it? The influence
of religion&mdash;especially so-called religion&mdash;is
nearly as obscure; but nationality and individuality
we can to some extent comprehend. No better
epithets are to be found for Haydn than the time-honoured
ones of "genial," "cheerful." We like to
think of him under his poor old gable-roof, that let
in the rain&mdash;happy at his poor old spinnet. Touching
picture! the irrepressible spirit of the obscure
composer, miserably poor, and neglected, for the first
fifty or sixty years of his life! But the stars, we
know, shone in on him through that dim old gable;
and the grass outside was not fresher in spring than
the spirit of Joseph Haydn. If reading, alone,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
maketh a "full man," as Bacon says, then Joseph
Haydn was, I imagine, a very empty one. He knew
nothing of books, or society, and little of men;
<i>direct</i> out of the fulness of his melodious heart he
uttered himself forth in poetic music essentially
genial and vigorous, "spraying over," as our German
cousins say, with kindly humour. A "man child" he
was, who will ever be historically&mdash;if not contemporaneously&mdash;immortal.
The great forerunners! we
owe them a debt which we must at last lose out of
sight; but verily they <i>have</i> their reward! Haydn's
fundamental simplicity and child-like objectiveness,
utterly prevented him from giving us Beethovenian
music. He neither read, nor thought&mdash;nor did he feel
very deeply. The doubts and difficulties which Brendel
finely (though mistakenly, perhaps) speaks of Mozart's
having fought out beforehand unconsciously, Haydn
neither consciously nor unconsciously experienced.
He was simply and purely a German musical genius
of his time, blessed with one of the happiest constitutions
ever given to mortal&mdash;<i>mens sana in corpore
sano</i>. The unfathomable and infinitely involved
beauty of Beethoven's symphonies is not to be dreamt
of in Haydn. Those of the latter, indeed, may smell
at times rather of the peruke than of the lion's mane
(whence what "dew-drops"!) But such melodious
eloquence as Haydn's "Hymn to the Emperor," one
cannot imagine perishing&mdash;it is like a rainbow out of
the Eden-time, hung for ever in heaven. The "Creation,"
too, is so inexpressibly fresh, naïve, vigorous,
and beautiful, that it has given to some more <i>pleasure</i>
than the very "Messiah." "The heavens are telling,"
must be surely also melodious eloquence
immortal, with its exquisite opening and noble
culmination. The music of Haydn (Mozart
too) may, perhaps, emphatically be called natural;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
in spite of&mdash;especially in the minuets&mdash;that <i>non so che</i>
which summons up the old-fashioned continental
<i>noblesse</i> and the frigid gardens of Versailles. If we
<i>want</i> a taste of this&mdash;or, also, after our higher flights
(and none the less after our intermediate and subterranean
flights in the wizard world of a Wagner),
a banquet in the unlaboured loveliness of old time,
we shall recur to Haydn; but if we want the higher
flights, and broader flights, and deeper flights themselves,
the sublime loveliness and Alpine grandeur&mdash;not
Saxon Switzerland, but Tell's&mdash;we shall hasten
with reverence and gladness to Beethoven, who towers
above Haydn&mdash;and also above these colossal upshoots
of this later "tertiary" period; for these latter men
seem rather intense than universal; whereof more
anon. A German word or two (they are always interesting,
because earnest,) about Haydn, and we turn
to Mozart. "Köstlin's remark about Haydn holds
good also for his symphonies:&mdash;With Haydn began
the free-style epoch, the spring and golden age of
music. In him, music became conscious that she
was not system and science, but free motion, and
lyrical." Free motion&mdash;yes, significant words. What
<i>e.g.</i>, would the sea, would light be, without that?
Undulatory free light! And I had as lief compare
music with light as anything. As postscript here, we
may recall Haydn's indignant exclamation after a
Dryasdust dictum by the then pedantic oracle, Albrechtsberger,
respecting, forsooth&mdash;I believe&mdash;our
old acquaintances, those irrepressible "consecutive
fifths":&mdash;"This will never do"! exclaimed Haydn,
"art must be free." How really curious it is, your
pedant never flashes <i>such</i> a glance into things&mdash;into
his own trade. But, indeed, the poor man can never
have a glimmering of what one little word, yet so
<i>multum in parvo</i>, like "free" means. He is full of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
learning, it is true, but still "in block"; and when the
Apollo at his side suddenly takes wings, and flashes
out of the marble, he knows not, poor man, whether
he is more astounded or indignant. A clever man
called Shakespeare, also, a barbarian. When will
Dryasdust see that, <i>c&oelig;teris paribus</i>, where innovation
is the step of genius, and <i>not ignorance</i>, he, Dryasdust,
had better, at least for a while, hold his tongue; see,
rather, if he can't, by a dead-lift effort, raise himself
up to Apollo, than try (ridiculously enough) to drag
down the god flashing to the sun. I fear the difficulty
is insuperable, because subjective. The misfortune
is, Dryasdust never <i>can</i> recognize genius, but
wanders on with his blue "specs." to his unvisited
grave.</p>

<p>But, to recur to Elterlein, <i>ueber</i> Haydn:&mdash;"When
we look into Haydn's symphonies a little closer, with
a glance at the same time at Haydn's followers, we
find them stamped by greater simplicity in the expression
of feeling, and by a limitation to certain well-defined
spheres of mood and humour. This characteristic
we may express in the definition, pure child-like
ideality. Of course, we do not mean literal
childhood, but rather abstract childhood in the soul
and constitution, whose representation is worthy of
the greatest of artists, <i>e.g.</i>, of a Schumann in his
charming 'Kinderscenen.' Naïve child humour
plays a leading part in Haydn's symphonies; wherefore
Brendel rightly names him the greatest master of
sport and mood. Of inner necessity, the pangs and
earnest of life, in their entirety, are excluded from
these works. They do now and then appear, but
only as light clouds skimming over. Haydn's restrictedness
is, however, far from limiting his invention;
on the contrary, we are astounded at it; he is veritably
inexhaustible in his mode of expressing himself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
The minuets are generally playgrounds for the
most delicious sportive humour. (In Haydn himself
we discover the germs of the so-called programme
music:&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, symphonies entitled 'The Bear,' 'Maria
Theresa,' 'The Schoolmaster'). We now turn to
Mozart.</p>

<p>Mozart was a world's-wonder in his boyhood, and
neglected&mdash;especially at Vienna, and by the court&mdash;in
his manhood. He has been denominated the most
abstract musician that ever lived&mdash;a term which is
more or less suggestive, if not precise. But, in so
far as it points to his being wholly and solely a musician,
it points to a defect and hindrance in him. (It
has been said, however, that he had a great aptitude
also for figures, and would have made no contemptible
mathematician. His parents were one of the handsomest
couples of their day.) Robert Schumann's
wonderful music, so rich in contents (<i>inhaltreich</i>),
sprang from a cultivated poet, equally practised with
the heart, and soul, and brain, and hand. Wagner's
marvellous art is the birth of a similar genius. In
short, the age we live in has certainly this advantage:
an artist now must be an educated man (in many
senses). Haydn and Mozart&mdash;who never found time for
study&mdash;were ill-informed, nay, ignorant men. They
knew nothing of the past, little of the present, and
less than nothing of the future. Beethoven, I think,
certainly did know more&mdash;if only a little&mdash;and compensated
for his deficiency by what alone can compensate&mdash;overpowering
genius, universally colossal.
I do not undertake to affirm that greater culture would
have improved Haydn and Mozart, but I throw out
the suggestion. Possibly, by expanding their minds,
and strengthening their faculties, it might have done
so. By reading (not only musical) they might
have got new lights&mdash;loam and enrichment to their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
own fertile soil; they might have, at least, <i>widened</i>
that channel of inspiration which they were. A man's
utterance, whether it be musical or other, is, at
bottom, the outcome of the whole man. I know, that,
in literature, such "education" as I have glanced at&mdash;a
discipline and growth all ways, through <i>communion</i>
with deeper and higher spirits, and thoughts, and
truths, has the effect I speak of. Natural genius is
deepened, and enriched, and expanded, and sent up
higher; roots and leaves, with increased fruit-capacity,
grow together. It may be, therefore, that Haydn and
Mozart, <i>minus</i> a Shakespeare's genius (which seems an
utter self-justified exception), owe their deficiency in
music to their deficiency in culture&mdash;in a scientifically
comprehensive sense. They were <i>too</i> much musicians.
It may be, that the fact of their lack was
partly also due to an original inherent non-proclivity
to culture. If so, here we have a deeper explanation;
the bare fact is seen to be the symptom of a radical
cause. But Beethoven was a born thinker: remember
his flashes of remark:&mdash;"Read Shakespeare's 'Tempest.'
'So knocketh Fate at the portals.' 'I have
another law for myself than Kant's "Categorical Imperative."'
'Better water from my body than from
my pen.'" He was a born thinker; and in this fact
we have the deeper explanation of his mighty music.
Do we not see the fact stamped on his very brows!
the very thrones of concentrated thought,&mdash;as the deep-set
eyes full of dusky fire in the lion-like head are
the homes of intense feeling, such as, possibly, no
man equalled. The comparison, let alone the
coupling, of Mozart with Shakespeare, I, for one,
cannot for a moment away with; in fact, am inclined
to cry with that author who could not tolerate a similar
bracketing of Turner with Shakespeare, "Bah!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
There is a power, a depth, a <i>seraphic</i> wisdom of inspiration
and universal view, an oracular utterance and
constructive power <i>from within</i> (the nearest approach
to the Divine <i>modus operandi</i> itself) in Shakespeare
which Mozart can lay no proper claim to. The theory
which would make his "Don Juan" characters
(forsooth!) display this similar power&mdash;in the organic
dramatic verisimilitude of the music&mdash;I cannot
endorse. Only a very long way off is your Mozart
like Shakespeare, with whom, properly, no one can
measure, or be likened. He stands alone, a phenomenal
unique. Such divine propriety he had!
the intellect of an archangel; and a prolonged
moulding-from-within power from Nature. Mozart
had a lovely, sometimes heavenly, profuse&mdash;not
incontinent&mdash;gift of melody, which is wont, however,
to tire (unlike Beethoven's), by being too
Mozartish; a marvellous genius for counterpoint;
and a beautiful instinct for harmony and form. He
was, <i>par excellence</i>, amiable; his music is loveable.
He shines like the sun on a mild spring day. That
he has serenity, as Shakespeare had, of course is
patent and cardinal; but that it is Shakespeare's serenity
I must beg to dispute. Shakespeare's is profound
as the centre of the sun; Mozart's is rather diffusive
than profound or moonlike. Shakespeare's is that of a
god-like man; Mozart's that of an "eternal child."
Mozart's is that of the Mediterranean; Shakespeare's of
the whole ocean. And of Shakespeare&mdash;not of Mozart
(according to our instinct)&mdash;may it be so eloquently
asserted, "his serenity is that of one" (a <i>Potente</i>, as
Dante says) "who had unconsciously fought out
beforehand all the doubts and difficulties, and put
them to flight." Mozart is supposed to have been
"light o' love," if not fond of wine too. To be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
"light o' love" goes very well with the composer of
"Don Juan," but I do not think anybody ever charged
it on the inspirer of the passionate grandeur of the
Countess Guicciardi sonata; of the heroic, C minor
and other symphonies. <i>Had</i> he been so, we should
have had <i>such</i> strains of remorse wailing up. Do we
find them in Mozart? I trow not!&mdash;"Thy terrible
beauty, Remorse, shining up from the depths of
pain!" Mozart is cheerful, beautiful, at times vigorous;
but surely somewhat light&mdash;a mountain lake with
fleecy clouds, not the sea, with its sunsets and thunders.
Not <i>his</i> serenity, but Beethoven's rather, presupposes,
like the sun of summer, and calm heart of
nature, all the storms fought out(?) Was there, as in
Beethoven, a soul of earnestness in him? Had he
aim, consciously, or unconsciously? Does he speak
from inspired depths, almost painful? Had he a
glimmering of atheism? Did he ever clutch at the
vanishing skirts of the Almighty? Could he kill
himself almost, to be sure of immortality? So far
from thinking he had thought and fought all these
things out, consciously or unconsciously, we feel that
he had no experience of them&mdash;<i>could</i> not have&mdash;and
so was for ever an incomplete man. "He knew not
ye, ye mighty powers." Sunshine he can give us;
yes, but sunshine <i>and</i> thunderglooms (say, tropical)&mdash;roar
of ocean, and spasm of lightning&mdash;no. His best
symphonies will not strictly compare with Beethoven's
best; his sonatas still less. And it is no very adventurous
prediction (however horrifying to sundry), that
his "Don Juan"&mdash;"the first opera in the world"(!),
with its contemptible trash for libretto, and meagre
musical constituents, will hide its diminished head more
and more, till it disappear. Mozart, says the German
essayist, means operas rather than symphonies:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
well, and what did he make of them? At this time
of day, it is simply inconceivable how any intelligent
man&mdash;let alone a tone-poet&mdash;could set trash by the
hour or week together. It has become almost a trite
idea now, that poetry is the soul of music: <i>caeteris
paribus</i>, in proportion as the word is divine, so will
the flesh be, which it takes unto itself and moulds
from within, in which it eventuates. How great by
comparison is Handel here! We have but to think
of his words&mdash;"Hallelujah! Lord God Omnipotent!
He shall reign for ever and ever, Amen!" to explain
why we may search Mozart in vain for a Hallelujah
Chorus, that temple of immortality! Beethoven, indefinitely
higher and greater than Mozart, did have a
notion of the exigency of the word&mdash;he spent hours
and hours looking through some hundred libretti for
an opera, and rejected them all. In setting trash,
poor dear Mozart, the gifted, the easy-going nature,
conscious of little but his fluent genius, and thinking
of little but winning his painful bread for the
day passing over, did not reflect that he was guilty of
sacreligious high treason; as it were, of violation of
Pallas Athene herself. "Music!" another of those
<i>infinite</i> words! When will her servants be worthy of
her? When will she suffer the veil to be completely
drawn away, and reveal herself in her full beauty?
Not by the hands of a Mozart, with his deplorable
"Don Juans" and chaotic nonsense of magic flutes.
In his better sacred music he is better. But even in
that I detect neither real belief&mdash;which can alone justify
sacred music, and ensure its highest excellence&mdash;nor
a great soul. Mozart was an inspired child;
when grown up, a child-man&mdash;as Hadyn was a man-child.
Nature selected him to speak out this element
in her, as she selected Beethoven to speak out her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
passion and paradox, her divine and her terrible
beauty&mdash;her world-wide grandeur&mdash;the infinitude of
her universe; as she selected Schumann to speak out
her romance, and twilight beauty; and Wagner her
supernatural, demoniac, wizardlike. We must
recollect, too, that Mozart was the child of his time.
Every man is this, more or less, <i>plus</i> his individuality.
Now, in truth, Mozart seems rather "more," not "less."
Beethoven approaches Shakespeare, in being for all
time; but not Mozart. His individuality was not
strong enough. I cannot agree with Elterlein, that
Mozart represents "fair, free, humanity," if we are to
give a higher, a Shakesperian meaning to these words.
Shakespeare was truly representative of the Wisdom,
viz., that covers the whole world, and every age; and
belongs neither to the past, present, nor future, but
to all time&mdash;to all three together; and so is the unique
shadow afar off in the history of man, of the eternal
I Am and Now. But such high language we can by
no manner of means apply to Mozart, who hadn't a
tithe of Shakespeare's insight and power; nor a third
part of Goethe's&mdash;with whom Elterlein and others also
put him. The "fair, free, humanity," which, in its
unfettered action and thought towers towards the
divine, which has long ago sloughed away, or stepped
out of old crusts and rags of prejudice, superstition,
and the things whose name is legion&mdash;but which remains
equally free from shallow sin and selfish action;
from the paralysis of indifferentism, and the laziness
of no-thought; from mere bread-winning, and waste
of genius (which waste is always rapidly hurried into
oblivion)&mdash;this "fair, free, humanity," Mozart does
not, can not, as it seems to us, represent. Shakespeare
and Goethe truly do. And Beethoven, in his
happier, victorious moods&mdash;in his darker moods he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
shadows forth rather man on the way to it; or, indeed,
on the way from it. Elterlein couples Mozart with
Raphael, as well as Goethe; that may pass; but who
can imagine either of the two former being capable of
a "Werther" and "Faust"? Mozart may "stand
alone" for "amiability," and may truly enjoy the reputation
of giving us, more or less, organic form; but
he was a limited, local nature, neither based on the
lowest deeps nor towering into the highest heights.
He was no reformer&mdash;did not revolutionize music (his
operas are but German-Italian by an Italian-German,
to that extent), no one can call him colossal. He
was a palm, rather than an oak. Handel, to me, is a
name far grander. Like Beethoven, I would bare my
head at <i>his</i> tomb. And now let us turn to the shadowy
colossus himself&mdash;towering aloft</p>

<p class="center">"In stifled splendour and gloom."<br /></p>

<p>If there are some nouns that affect us, there are
some proper nouns that equally do so. One of the
most potent of these is "Beethoven." At the mere
mention of that name, we experience a "shock of joy"
and reverence at once vaguely and vastly filling us
with the sublime and beautiful&mdash;the grand and tender;
in short, with all those attributes, in a degree, of Nature,
for this seems to be the special and peculiar function
and privilege of genius&mdash;of great human nature&mdash;to
reflect and reproduce, with, as before noted, the force
and charm peculiar to itself, nature, divinity. Great
men are distinguished by the height to which they
tower in doing this; they are but further manifestations
of God&mdash;revelations of arcana. Up to our time, no
man in any art has so towered aloft more than Beethoven.
Armed with the most mystical of prophecies
and utterance&mdash;music, he strewed abroad upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
winds and world such pregnant messages as stirred
men to depths they were before unconscious of, and
live and operate with the force of immortality. Let
us approach these wonderful works and glance more
or less into their truly divine depths. We shall not,
however, by any means be indiscriminate&mdash;in the
sympathy of the hero-worshipper forget the justice of
the judge. We shall not forget that the best of men
are but men at best; and that, for our comfort and
ensample, as ever, the great Beethoven was also a
child, a beginner, a student, an acolyte, as well
as imperial master; and, alas! mortal man&mdash;with his
sad liability to madness and decay; with his basis on
the infernal, as well as heights in the divine.</p>

<p>In the first place, what shall we say about the peculiarly
original Beethoven's reflection at the outset of
Hadyn and Mozart? At first sight, it rather jars.
But shall we he correct if after consideration we pronounce
that this is rather a merit, and to be expected,
than otherwise; for it is characteristic of hero-worship,
which is most passionate in genius truly original.
Shakespeare, perhaps, is the great or even sole exception;
but, as it is borne in on us, Shakespeare seems
to be unique&mdash;a semi-god, or "seraph," rather than
mere man; and I, for one, have no disinclination or
repugnance to own that Beethoven, like the rest, does
not equal Shakespeare. In parts he does&mdash;perhaps
even gives us more terribly grand glances into depths
than <i>Macbeth</i> and <i>Lear</i>&mdash;but not as a whole. It
the whole of Shakespeare that is so unique and overpowering.
Beethoven often suggests rather Dante
and Milton; though it is his peculiar praise, too, that
he suggests all three, and yet is like none.</p>

<p>And now to work:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<h2><a name="Symphony_No_1_OP_21" id="Symphony_No_1_OP_21"><span class="smcap">Symphony No. 1, OP. 21.</span></a></h2>


<p>"Opus 21."&mdash;So, when Beethoven came of age,
musically speaking, he wrote his first symphony.
Ah! who can realize the feelings of a Beethoven
sitting down to write his first symphony; <i>fuller</i> feelings
probably were not, and could not, be in the
world, among all the manifestations of human existence.
What flush of hope! what throbs of pleasure!
what high-beating plethora of imaginative
blood! what almost painful fulness!&mdash;necessity to
rush forth in poetic utterance, and fling all together
what of latent as well as patent was within him!
what struggling consciousness&mdash;what waking sense of
giant powers&mdash;what secret assurance in the end of
immortal victory, nay, perhaps, of an empire in music
towering aloft above that of Hadyn and Mozart
and predecessors and successors of all nations and
individualities. I envy neither the powers nor immortality
of that contemporary, Napoleon, compared
with those of Beethoven:&mdash;Meteoric Corsican adventurer&mdash;eternal
eldest son of genius! Dazzling egotist
and semi-quack&mdash;concentrated sun of nature and the
imperishable heavens!&mdash;I wonder what Beethoven
had been reading previous to undertaking his first
symphony&mdash;what he had been doing, talking, thinking!
I like to picture imaginary scenes where he
sat down to the intoxicating enterprise. Was it in
the country, of an early morning, all dripping in the
sunshine like the orange-bowers here, with the sun
welcoming with his sweetest smile the fleecy clouds
wandering up the heaven? Or was it (probably it
was, for reality is painfully prosaic,) in some back
attic&mdash;such as where Shakespeare perhaps wrote <i>his</i>
symphonies? The sublimely interesting young Beethoven!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
There he sits for a moment with his two
hands pressed on those concentrated brows of the
lion-like head, previously to penning the first chord!
There he sits&mdash;look at him well&mdash;the fullest incarnation
of music, till now the greatest home, emporium,
and royal residence of musical power, with all which
that implies&mdash;including, lowest down, the ineffable;
for, always, a man is tender in proportion as he is
strong, great in proportion as he is good&mdash;Ludwig
van Beethoven, in his divine genius and terrible
infliction (one of the most painful ironies of human
history&mdash;like a fate out of high Greek story), one of
the most intensely interesting of the race of men!</p>

<p>And now for our criticism; or, rather, for our
impressions&mdash;for every one of us is dominated by
unknown moods and biasses. And the wise spirit
which made Goethe call his autobiography "Fact and
Fancy," should rule every critic&mdash;often the victim
and slave of himself, the child of circumstance and
time.</p>

<p>First, for a general remark:&mdash;I see no essential
difference&mdash;query, should there be?&mdash;between a symphony,
especially a Beethoven one, and a sonata.
Next, as corollary, let us even say that some of his
sonatas (or at least parts) surpass the symphonies.
For instance, that first part of the sonata "Patetica,"
as it is absurdly called, always impresses me as
something really almost colossal&mdash;the "grave" itself
truly so, like a temple four-square, based on the
foundations of the world, and high towering towards
all the winds. There is no comparison between it
and any of the movements of the "No. 1 Symphony,"
except the first; and here, too, I am inclined to give
the palm to the "Patetica," which, <i>au reste</i>, curiously
enough is just as incongruously weak in the remaining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
movements as this symphony. Both, in fact, have
one element (or stamp) in common, viz., the energetic,
which we may characterise as martial&mdash;heroic. Beethoven
is peculiarly distinguished by this&mdash;<i>plus</i> a
tender beauty of the most profound and healthy
description. It is as with the fascinating Schumann;
who is equally conspicuous for the energetic and
tender&mdash;more mystical than Beethoven's, if not so
healthy. But, in spite of the ineffable in Beethoven,
I almost think we associate power more peculiarly with
him. With power Beethoven ushers in his "No. 1."
Mark that sforzando, and&mdash;B flat. A similar effect
occurs in the opening to "Prometheus" (which we
noticed independently of Berlioz). Here Beethoven&mdash;young
and consciously vigorous&mdash;took that step of genius
we adverted to as opposed to the rashness of ignorance;
as it were, champion king-at-arms, flinging the
gage of defiance to all the Dryasdusts alive. Poor
Dryasdust! who never can be manly enough or
genius enough to get free. Dryasdust, it is well
known, armed with his blue "specs" and properly obscured
thereby, enounces, pronounces, and proclaims&mdash;"Allah
Akbar! it is unlawful and forbidden to
open with a discord" (just as the poor Midas declares
it is unpermissible to end in any other key&mdash;what has
that got to do with it?). Young Beethoven, however&mdash;thank
the god of originality&mdash;has inspired instinct&mdash;says
"No," and "Take that! you'll soon get used to
it." We do get used to it, and then&mdash;O the copyists!
That B flat is a stroke of genius. Hence we learn,
from what <i>depths</i> genius speaks&mdash;your Beethoven
young and vigorous, fresh into the world, henceforth
to be a lawgiver and creator of the imperishable.
That "B flat" is power; in short, all that originality
includes and implies. But, to pass on from this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
point, which&mdash;as every point&mdash;might furnish an essay.
The <i>p</i> after the <i>sf</i> is noteworthy; so, too, the chords&mdash;powerfully
beautiful, unexpected. The strain is
not peculiarly Beethoven; it does give us a taste of
that Ineffable in him, but is meagrely brief&mdash;in fact,
fragmentary and uncharacteristic&mdash;besides, too much
suggesting "Prometheus." <i>Re</i> the latter, a word <i>en
parenthèse</i>. After hearing it, Haydn met Beethoven
and complimented him on it. "Yes," said the young
giant, "but it does not equal the 'Creation'". "No,
I don't think it quite does," was the reply from the
old maestro, "who didn't seem to like the remark."
Poor, dear old Haydn! the glimmering suspicion he
had was true enough&mdash;that young giant would shake
dew-drops from the lion's mane more precious than
the grandest Louis Quatorze peruke, plus the unspeakable
Louis himself&mdash;sarcasm apart, would infallibly
eclipse even Haydn's "Creation," naïve and fresh as
that may be. We approach the "Allegro" <i>con amore</i>.
It stirs our depths; it fills us with ideas. <i>En passant</i>,
it opens with the same notes of the Sonata in F, Op. 54
(I think). This is another proof that it is not quite
true that even Beethoven "never repeats himself;"
though it is perhaps true enough to be said&mdash;because
characteristic; and when he repeats himself, he generally
does so consciously&mdash;the great point (another
text for essay). The <i>p</i> on the chord C E G rather surprises
us&mdash;we expect a forte(?)&mdash;but it has original
beauty, and makes an harmonious breathing instead
of an emphatic utterance. The following, in the bass,
is equally characteristic. As it goes on, the passage
is powerfully suggestive, especially at the <i>cresc.</i> in
unison. The mind's-eye sees a great river rising to
overflow its mountain-guarded banks; or, forsooth, a
great nation, to guard them! All this is the early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Beethoven almost at his best&mdash;a true foreshadower of
<i>the</i> Beethoven&mdash;as much as to say, I <i>am</i> Beethoven,
in spite of Haydn, my very good master, and Mozart.
We see the giant waking. About the next <i>motiv</i> I
hardly know what to say. In one mood it strikes me,
like many other things even in Beethoven, as an
incongruity; I think, "Why all at once this pastoral
strain in the middle of a warlike defiance!" Such
unconsciousness as this is an error. A genius must
be an artist as well; and a man has no right to fling
the first idea that occurs to him into a piece, which is
incongruous with the whole. Undoubtedly Beethoven
himself sinned here, and not seldom. It is notorious
that he tacked on and foisted in pieces which literally
had nothing to do with the work as a whole. Lazy
or even thoughtless bad taste is a high crime in art&mdash;for
art truly means, tasteful industry. The sense of
fitness must not be offended. Incongruity is a great
fault. The men of the conscious school are right
here. Consciousness truly has its duties as
well as its dangerous frailty. So we argue in that
mood. But yet again, so diversified is music, we
feel a peculiar, almost unspeakable charm, when,
sympathetic fancy coming to our assistance, we consider
this abstractly beautiful strain as giving us a
glance back from the press of warriors and the noise
of battle, to the green fields and silver streams
far off we have left; and we think of Arnold von
Winkelried leaving his wife and children, as in Deschwanden's
affecting picture, so familiar in Switzerland.
Then, almost tears come into the eyes, and
we exclaim&mdash;Oh! thou unconscious wizard, Beethoven!&mdash;making
us give to thy utterances a meaning
thou thyself never didst dream of. Soon again, after
this wistful glance back&mdash;with none of the sin in it of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Lot's wife&mdash;we have the thunder and blaze of war, with
his pride, pomp, and circumstance. Nay, I will
say, are we not even reminded of the world-famous
Symphony, No. 8, itself? Have we not essentially
the same clamour and glamour? our blood is roused,
hearts beat high, and we feel we are on the road to
righteous victory&mdash;"Against the tyrant fought with
holy glee." The <i>pp</i> strain ensuing does not strike
as incongruous, but of peculiar feeling and beauty.
How beautifully melody, harmony, and bass, are all
one&mdash;work together for good, and progress to the
climax. As a bit of writing, it is a model for study;
a very charming instance of the success of true
scholarship and feeling&mdash;scholarship based on feeling;
scholarship unconscious, so that the effect is
nature. The codetta carries us back again to the
pastoral mood&mdash;whence we are congruously re-taken
to the warlike by the pompous vague chords&mdash;long
used before Stephen Heller, for instance!&mdash;at the
end.</p>

<p>Part No. 2 suggests at the outset one broad general
remark, which we hasten to make. It is this.
Beethoven, herein not original, but imitative, generally
confines himself&mdash;in the sonatas as well&mdash;to
making the second part mostly a mere elaboration of
the first. Now, we beg&mdash;at all events, at this time of
day&mdash;to dissent from, and traverse this. We are for
making your first part long enough, and repeating it
if you will; but for giving us mostly new ideas, yet
in character, in the second. We are not afraid of the
"as a whole" theory; <i>da capo</i> we traverse the dogma
that what you have got to do is, to give one good
idea thoroughly worked out. Wagner has carried
this to a wearisome excess. We want no opera or
symphony constructed out of "four notes" or forty.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
elaboration does not disguise&mdash;or rather conceal&mdash;the
essential sameness&mdash;which becomes tameness. And
we don't want as sets-off mere "episodes." Beethoven's
episodes, as here, are of course, interesting;
but, because episodes (?) fragmentary, intercalated,
rather than essential; postponements of the old
"Hauptsache," rather than independent new ideas.
Because this second part is essentially but an elaboration
(often a mere repetition, in another key, of
ideas already repeated&mdash;surely, for the most part, an
exploded error?), we have little new to say. The
harmonious progressions to the episodes will be
studied and felt by every musician. The minor
passage, la&mdash;do&mdash;mi&mdash;sol nat.&mdash;la, is fine, but not
novel in Beethoven. The crash, <i>ff</i>, is characteristically
grand; the whole elaboration full again of
power&mdash;power that <i>is</i>, and prophetic power to do;
power latent and patent. At the beautiful contrapuntal
passage in E flat we are again reminded of
the F Sonata. The melodious breathings&mdash;which
must be studied&mdash;a little farther on, teach us the very
beautiful and interesting lesson (another subject for
essay) of the unconscious effect of imitation; and of
the unconscious imitation which often lies in effect.
The progressions and culminations are Beethovenially
grand; in fact, the whole second part superior, if
possible, to the first, once admitted the right or propriety
of the <i>modus operandi</i>. As a whole, the movement
stands four-square, noble, filling us with the
benefit and pleasure of energetic beauty. This is
life&mdash;<i>mens sana in corpore sano</i>; no hint or shadow of
madness; youthful power, generosity, enthusiasm,
valour, and hope. At that utterance when first
heard, once more men must have felt "a man-child
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
is born into the world;" and the government shall be
upon his shoulders&mdash;note especially, the do, do, la,
do sharp, passage, and other culminations. Here,
though Beethoven has not surpassed, if rivalled, the
"Allegro" of Op. 13, he has given it a worthy counterpart.
We are invigorated, and cheered&mdash;nay, roused
to enthusiasm; poured full of virtuous resolve and
noble daring. <i>Lebe hoch der junge Beethoven! Au
reste</i>&mdash;we should have to use much colder language
for the other movements (except the splendid minuet,
so superior to the trio, which also suggests incongruity&mdash;unless
we like to call it contrast?). The
andante seems in no way superior to Haydn, and
becomes veritably <i>langweilig</i>. How inferior to the
"Andante, Op. 26!" The rondo is, comparatively,
mere trifling&mdash;we are inclined to say, unworthy of
Beethoven. We have no real pleasure in playing it,
but constantly think, "Oh, for the first movement!"
Summing up this symphony, we may perhaps decide:
On the whole, guilty of incongruity&mdash;of want of
proper consciousness. Why this halting between the
pastoral and warlike? If your "as a whole" theory
is good for a movement, why not for a symphony?
due allowance for contrast excepted. Certainly, it may
be said, the symphony is of unequal value; and that
had Beethoven given us all equal to the "Allegro," it
would have been a truly great symphony, quite
worthy of his great name. As it is, the allegro
and minuet alone partake of the immortal.</p>

<h4>THE ADAGIO.</h4>

<p>The worn-out despot offered a premium for a new
pleasure; the critic would often do so for a new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
epithet. How shall I characterize this exquisite
prelude? It is as the portico to the Walhalla of the
gods. Here we have the real Beethoven in his
<i>divine</i> profundity&mdash;profound, <i>because</i> beautiful; its
very beauty constituting the depth, as it were, <i>thickening</i>
into it, like the ocean and heaven. This beauty,
the true Proteus, is evasive; its import was not clear
to the utterer himself, no message of the Divine is, to
the human vehicle&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"A coral conduit ivory cisterns filling."</p>

<p>We cannot exactly translate or interpret it, only we
feel that <i>were</i> it translated, we should have a divine
poem in a divine language. One could spend hours
going into the details of it&mdash;for every note demands
a word; those two opening ones namely. How characteristic!
There is the Emperor Tone-Poet, Napoleon
of music, commanding "Attention!" and not&mdash;God
forbid!&mdash;for himself, but for his message. It is
the "Thus saith the Lord" of the prophet (some
Elijah) of old. Utterance so simple&mdash;so all-compelling!
Those two notes, merely, are, as it were,
like the slightest scratch of an apostle. Then the
next three bars! They at once usher us into that
ineffability of Beethoven's which we spoke of. We
have no reluctance to admitting that originality is not
particularly studied here. Nay, we are inclined to
say something higher&mdash;the modesty and moral courage
to reject originality is displayed. Beethoven
had to deliver that "Thus saith the Lord!" and he
did it. First feel, and then study, the <i>un</i>studied
eloquence of it. It is one of the beautiful instances
whose name is legion in Beethoven, of simplicity&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"In its simplicity sublime."</p>

<p>To me it says&mdash;"There! the storms <i>are</i> all fought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
out. Peace, after all, is at the bottom, and in the
heart." Or it is like a high man&mdash;say Beethoven
himself&mdash;after the despicable petty disgusts, as well as
chaotic horrors of life, falling back upon nature, the
eternal star-glimmering universe&mdash;"they will not repel
and deceive me, they are everlasting and sublime!"
The phrase&mdash;like every great message&mdash;is really indescribable
except by itself; the profound peace, or
rather peaceful profundity of it, are unutterable&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"O that my tongue could utter"&mdash;</p>

<p>It is a great instance of height towering out of depth,
high because deep, a peak in music, yet not clad with
eternal glacier, except for its purity of heart, but
eternal sunbeams.</p>

<p>After an interesting passage of "harmonious breathing"
interposed, and the still more interesting one of
chromatic part-repetition, the shakes&mdash;which are ultimately
to play a great part&mdash;first make their appearance.
The taste for the shake can soon degenerate;
and Beethoven himself sometimes used it incontinently.
But, when properly introduced, as here, and
especially at the last, it is an ornament that has a
more or less magical charm.</p>

<p>The next noble bit reminds us a little of the "Funeral
March" in the A flat Sonata. Thereupon Beethoven,
in his unconscious or conscious unconscious progress,
promulgates some of these characteristic utterances of
his&mdash;those harmonious and melodic breathings, so
profound and pregnant with we know not what.
Who or what moved him to his wonderful "progressions?"
Truly indescribable tone-poet! so deep
with tenderness, so rich with glow&mdash;glow is where
Beethoven exceeded all of them, especially the Saxon
school; he added glow to height, breadth, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
depth; or, rather, his glow and depth&mdash;as in the sun&mdash;are
like cause and effect, one.</p>

<p>Now follow those warblings&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wild bird! whose warble liquid sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rings Eden through the budded quicks,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and "deep answering unto deep," which we mentally
alluded to at the outset, hard to decipher, seraphically
beautiful. In what a musical river, to employ another
figure, or concourse of confluences, the inspired
orchestra rolls on; for yes, verily, the river is inspired
with utterance, big with its message. And this
is no merely European river, but rather some tropical
Zambesi or Amazon with its colossal origin and
surroundings; or, again, the river that rolls from
the throne of the Fountain of Life&mdash;which truth it
seems to declare, in the magnificent emphatic passage
(anticipating the choral symphony?) so originally
grand, in D minor, in unison, mark that. It seems
to say&mdash;"Hear that, and believe it. The rolling
river which this universe is, does not flow from Chaos
and Diabolus, but from Eternal Self-Justified Will&mdash;humanly
named, in short, 'God'; as it were, takes
its course through the bosom of God, as 'King John'
wished the rivers of his realm to, through his." After
this colossal passage, we seem to be invited to listen
to the warblings and happy murmurs in the halls of
heaven&mdash;the habitation of the blest, of just spirits
made perfect. It is all delicately, crystallinely ineffable;
and the language of imaginative sympathy
itself can scarcely transcend the beauty and exceeding
excellence of the whole movement&mdash;that profound
inspiration&mdash;any more than it can transcend the beauty
and exceeding excellence, amounting to divinity, of
the universe, that "Midsummer Night's Dream!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Allegro.</span></h4>

<p>I often doubt, war can never cease, for its element
is so great and potent in art&mdash;especially music and
her twin-sister, poetry. Carlyle specially speaks of
the "great stroke, too, that was in Shakespeare, had
it come to that;" and, indeed, makes this&mdash;together
with the "so much unexpressed in him to the last"&mdash;in
short, his infinitude, the very thing which Schubert's
kindred eye saw in Beethoven, differentiating him, his
two chief points of admiration and test in general of
a man. Besides, in our great historian himself&mdash;in
Milton, too&mdash;we feel that there was a great stroke, as
of the sublime Ironside; before him, in Dante; before
him, in Homer&mdash;perhaps, Virgil; but not Horace.
In our own day, the noble ring of our poet-laureate's
verse, to mention no more, is at once a voucher for
the same fact, apart from his "Maud," and more than
one indignant utterance. The poetic imagination
and classic beauty of all such men is not only concomitant
with, but inseparable from, a "good stroke in
them" (Dante and Cervantes were actually on the
battle-field)&mdash;from an heroic element, the best thing
they have. The greatest utterance&mdash;inspiration&mdash;cannot
possibly come from any other. The hero is
dear to God; the coward perhaps most despised of
all. And why? The reason is philosophical enough.
Because the soul of the universe is power&mdash;and without
courage there can be no goodness. The grand
doctrine of evolution, penetrating everywhere, has
brought home to us, and borne in upon us, that there
is not a field or a grove which is not the theatre of
perpetual struggle&mdash;not one manifestation exempt
from it. <i>Vae victis</i> is the word of Nature herself, and
the "struggle" is divinely ordained (competition is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the salt of existence) for the elaboration of energies&mdash;the
eventuation in higher life. What man would wish
for the <i>dolce far niente</i> of the Fool's Paradise? The
world hath been groaning and travailing until now, and
must for a long, long time to come; only one-fourth of
it is even now "civilized," and in that civilisation
what dregs and dens of barbarism seem ineradicable.
All sorts of wrong still tyrannise; therefore, spiritually
and physically, the warrior must stand forth great to
wage war against the bad everywhere, politically and
intellectually&mdash;against social evils, and art-darkness&mdash;against
lies, and for truth&mdash;against weakness, and for
strength; for Might <i>is</i> Right in the universe&mdash;weakness
is one with evil, strength with good. Only the
good is strong; only the bad is weak.</p>

<p>We have been led into these remarks by dwelling
on the fact, how frequently the warlike spirit manifests
itself forth in our Beethoven&mdash;indeed, is irrepressible;
nay, I am urged to say, cardinal. In spite of Beethoven's
truly divine beauty, he is stamped and distinguished
by power. When he issues young into the
arena, we see "victorious success" gleaming on his
brows. Handel is distinguished in the same way.
Hence the secret of Beethoven's own hero-worship for
him. Apollo is great, but Jupiter is greater&mdash;Jupiter
Optimus Maximus. If Mozart, Weber, Schubert
may, more or less, figure as the sun-god, they cannot
figure as the god of the sun-god. We might almost
say, the first notes of Beethoven proclaimed power.
He had to go forth and do battle with things. Nor
is his own struggle for existence (not mere being,
but immortality&mdash;a life in immortality here; that is
existence to your Beethoven) in his own life-element,
so strong and chaotic, in his own soul progress, undepicted,
or shadowed forth. With unconscious-consciousness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
did he do it&mdash;on, right on to the end, the
bitter end; on the verge of blindness, insanity&mdash;we
know not what. Rushing as he did, into the conflict,
conscious only of power, Beethoven would have been
struck had he seen what, through the long vista of
"stifled splendour and gloom," that power boded and
implied: he would have been awed, had it been revealed
to him what that power represented&mdash;little short of
the Nineteenth Century itself, with all its Hamlet
doubts, and chaotic, yet germ-rich smouldering of
transition, whereof more anon.</p>

<p>If the ineffable adagio&mdash;prelude of preludes (?),
out, as Marx says, the last movement is the finale of
finales&mdash;shows us the young God-disguised athlete,
with the morning light on his brow, making ready to
enter only the Olympian Games, the <i>allegro con brio</i>
shows him to us rushing into battle! The "heroic
symphony" is by no means the first or last symphony
heroic&mdash;indeed, could not have been written but for
the pre-existence and exercise of that full power in
the inspired young composer. Here is a grand epic
outburst and onrushing worthy of that immortal
masterpiece, and essentially one with it. We could
almost say, not only the same power, but the same
sort of power, is indiscernible in Haydn and Mozart.
The style (which is truly the man&mdash;that to the man
what the bark is to the tree) is so different&mdash;the
man's dialect, as well as message; the phraseology
altogether. These modulations are not those of
Haydn and Mozart! (beyond praise grand is the <i>ff</i>
on the dominant of A minor&mdash;one of those glorious
bursts and surprises of Beethoven's&mdash;we expect D
minor); nor is the masculine fancy (god-like shall we
say? and a Mozart's, goddess-like) theirs; and the
great broad, quasi-Titanic strains and themes. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
movement (Op. 36) is an advance on that of the
symphony No. 1 (Op. 21), if in grade only, not kind.
Here we see the young giant, not yet done growing,
a little riper. There is no strain in it which we feel
inclined to qualify, which "gives us pause," like the
second motiv in its predecessor; all is homogeneous,
epically great. But let us descend a little to details.
At bars 1, 2, and 3, we imagine the firm tread of the
warriors, singing (like the Ironsides before Dunbar&mdash;the
68th Psalm, "Let God arise,") on their way to
victory, which they never doubt for a moment, not
only because they are triumphant veterans, but on
account (and more) of their cause. At bar 4 what a
poetic rush (inrush) of fifes is suggested! then the
great step is heard again; a great strain joins in; the
chaunt of the warrior basses becomes more and more
ominous; preliminary thunder is heard, and at last,
with Olympian pæan and war-cry battle is joined;&mdash;great
is the shock, and glorious is the struggle!</p>

<p>The second subject in A is ushered in by those
grand <i>third-less</i> chords (long before our modern
writers):&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
   <img src="images/p_030.jpg" width="400" height="142" alt="Music Score" /><br />
   <a href="music_files/p-030.mid">[Listen]</a>
</p>

<p>the chromatic passage being doubled two octaves
below by the basses. The new subject, more absolutely
melodious, still keeps up the same theme&mdash;(for,
<i>apropos</i>, we may also look upon this allegro as some
Homeric or Shakespearian recital of a great victory&mdash;recall
the superb opening lines of "Richard the Third,"
the "warriors' wreathed brows, and their bruised arms
hung up for monuments"). At first it is heard softly&mdash;like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
a reinforcement in the distance (we think of the
Prussians at Waterloo, in the westering summer sun)&mdash;then
as it were in a blaze of music bursts in. Immediately
after, where its exquisite first half (so simple&mdash;mark
that&mdash;but so eloquent and picturesque) reappears in
the basses (high), we are rather reminded of Mendelssohn's
"Huntsman's Song without Words," in A
(the same key), Book 1; but&mdash;we need not say&mdash;Mendelssohn
has not gilded gold, or improved the
lily; for his fancy was distinctly lighter and smaller
than Beethoven's&mdash;or, let us say, he had fancy, Beethoven
imagination. And now a happy spirit of
triumph sings in the basses; and then burst out some
crashing Beethoven-chords, of which I will but point
to the one <i>ff</i> (5th bar of them); it is characteristically
the 6&mdash;4 of D&mdash;not, as anticipated, the 5&mdash;3 of F sharp minor.</p>

<p>Then, after a foreboding crescendo&mdash;characteristic
growth out of an initial fragment&mdash;and these two
emphatic notes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
   <img src="images/p_031.jpg" width="200" height="79" alt="Music Score" /><br />
   <a href="music_files/p-031.mid">[Listen]</a>
</p>

<p>&mdash;Beethoven all over&mdash;the first part closes, so to say, in
a breadth of thunder-peals and fiery rain. Technically,
note the grand entry of D minor, and mi&mdash;do&mdash;si&mdash;la&mdash;mi
in unison, with the 3rd omitted; and the
minor-seventh chords, resolving into the tonic dominant
of the minor (D<sup>1</sup>), so exquisitely expressive&mdash;alike
of the pangs of victory and the heroic resolution
to endure them.</p>

<p>In the 2nd Part, on the way to G minor (Beethoven
himself often never knew whither he was taking us,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
or at least the precise route&mdash;and so much the better!),
we soon meet with a remarkable juncture of
notes, viz., do and mi of the chord (G minor), with fa
superadded:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
   <img src="images/p_032.jpg" width="200" height="93" alt="Music Score" /><br />
   <a href="music_files/p-032.mid">[Listen]</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This fa, at first sight perplexing, turns out to be a
stray note (as it seems) of the minor seventh chord
on its way to the seventh, which, however, ultimately
appears (with beautiful effect) as the 3rd of the dominant-seventh
chord (to C minor). This powerfully,
painfully expressive dissonance is likewise to be found
in his "Lied Vom Tode" (Op. 48), amongst other
instances; and the opening to Schubert's "Wanderer"
owes its intense expression to the same. The <i>raison
d'être</i> of such discords is perhaps to be found in the
enhancement they give to the resolution. We could
not bear them too long, or too frequent; but, as a
passing reminder of the tragedy of life, they profoundly
move and interest us; and, perhaps, discords in
life (likewise instituted by no Dryasdust) have essentially
the same <i>raison d'être</i> and explanation&mdash;life is
<i>agro-dolce</i>, not <i>dolce</i> alone, and better so. Thereupon
we have a new idea, surely as playfully felicitous and
characteristic as the scherzo of the "Eroica" itself&mdash;like
the warriors at sport after victory; or like a
glimpse of the same by them, back in a pause in the
battle, which soon recommences, with the shouts of
the combatants and groans of the wounded and
dying. A page farther on, we have a truly sublime
episode; great is the chaunt on the earnest theatre
(proclaiming Right must and shall win) made up of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
sufficient chord of F sharp minor, and the basses moving
in such a way as served as a model for Wagner; this
is epic, heroic, indeed! and&mdash;even greater&mdash;Pelion
upon Ossa, piled by this Titan fighting on the side of
the gods, is the culmination. Semitone by semitone
mount the basses; and over all the great clouds
become richer in the setting sun, and pealing hosts of
heaven (as it were) join in the shouts of the victors,
crying&mdash;"Hosanna in excelsis! Alto trionfo del
regno verace! Right <i>is</i> done!"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Glory of warrior, glory of orator, glory of song,<br /></span>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Larghetto.</span></h4>

<p>At the moment we write, all round us we see nature
emerged&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"Nobler and balmier for her bath of storm."</p>

<p>The grim tempests of early winter have passed over,
and after a South-Italian night&mdash;a perfect blaze of
constellations, with the Evening Star incredible in the
west, large, lustrous, evanescent&mdash;and Orion sublime
in the forehead of the Night over the mountain&mdash;with
Jupiter passed over, Mars and Sirius not far off, and
the eternal cluster of the Pleiades (those beautiful
heralds) winging its flight towards the north-west, and
the leading star of the Ursus Major plunging through
the dusk (yet shining) over Naples; after such a
night, lo! the great amphitheatre of the world is a
spectacle indeed! The mountain-island sweeps like
a garden at our feet to the sea; the sea itself like an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
unspeakable floor or carpet spread out <i>for us</i>, bearing
the islands&mdash;the "great globe itself"&mdash;so proudly on
its nourishing bosom; and all round, out of a tender
dusk (as it were, like Compassion) rises the snow-peaked
world (like virtue clothing beauty, reason
crowning power), the magnificent spur of the Alps&mdash;showing
what mountains can do at an effort&mdash;called
the Apennines, stretching down and around from
Gaeta to Alicote, towering over treasures, as it
seems, of unearthly beauty; Monte St. Angelo, with
his colossal foot in the sea and roots in the world, his
wrinkles lined with snow, looms and towers before us;
on the right sweeps and bares itself the grand Bay of
Salerno, and on the left the proud Bay of Naples,
with its eternal Watch-fire, like a sentinel over all.
Stupendous scene of beauty and power! and all
that&mdash;on this heavenly morning, when the world once
more seems made again, and to overpower us with
its reiteration of Immortality&mdash;all that comes before
us as a grand subject set to music in this larghetto of
Beethoven's; all that, too&mdash;if the fancy may be allowed&mdash;seems
in the key of A natural. Before <i>it</i>, we
should like to hear this exquisite masterpiece&mdash;this,
I will not say, Song without Words, but rather Te
Deum laudamus&mdash;adequately performed, say by the
Künstler of his "Vaterland." Here we have a
sweetness and a serenity the more touching, because
they are <i>not</i> those of a Mozart, but a Beethoven;
those of nature, "<i>nobler and balmier</i> for her bath of
storm" (human as well as physical nature); whether
Mozart do or do not represent the storm already
fought out, this is the sweetness, not of sweetness,
but depth&mdash;the serenity, not of serenity, but power.
And, indeed, we must hold, and urge, that however
the objective may be of value, and rank pre-eminent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
in poetry, the greatest music has come down to us
from perhaps the greatest subjective soul; and essentially,
much of contemporary, morbidly-conscious
music seems in comparison not only objective but
material, not only material but sensational; the delusively
brilliant (phosphorescently brilliant) product of
a decaying time&mdash;we had almost said the elaborate
effeteness of a written-out age.</p>

<p>This larghetto is of Beethoven's first period, ripened
of course (strive as refiners may, they will scarcely be
able to alter the time-honoured division, so obviously
founded in truth). Haydn and Mozart are distinctly
discerned glimmering through it, but not very much
more; it is Haydn and Mozart <i>plus</i> Beethoven, which
makes all the difference. We repeat, it is <i>his</i> serenity
and sweetness, his youth (so full and rich&mdash;of such
<i>infinite</i> promise), not theirs. Theirs be the grace,
but his the grandeur; theirs the amiability, but his the
milk of human kindness&mdash;so broad and deep (as of a
yet unsoured Hamlet, an Othello, a King Lear; for
there are great characters in Shakespeare which we <i>can</i>
blend Beethoven with, but not the others). The
details of the larghetto must be studied (say, at the
organ). I will here only advert to its reminiscence
of the andante (the exquisite episode) in the pastoral
sonata, written about the same period, truly worthy of
symphonic treatment, with the deliciously-delicate
passage, as it were like a shower of sunbeams, of
gold sparkles&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"In the æther of Deity"</p>

<p>(as the manifestations named men have been called).
The movement is rich both in the great strokes and
tender touches of genius&mdash;of genius which is power;
and what we call the phraseology of the man as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
whole, and in its parts, is again beautifully Beethovenian.
Here is a lovely bit:&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">
   <img src="images/p_036.jpg" width="300" height="181" alt="Music Score" /><br />
   <a href="music_files/p-036.mid">[Listen]</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The movement is not so <i>great</i> as the preceding, and
is perhaps too long (which is a decided art-fault&mdash;not
merely a mistake in judgment); but, as a whole, it
reminds us of Shakespeare's "entire and perfect
chrysolite;" we greet it (and other movements of
Beethoven's) with feelings of profound affection; as
though we had realised those words "Yet a little
while and ye have me with ye"; as though we had
been living, for at least a breathing space, in the
atmosphere and society of higher life, out of the
sphere of time and in the sphere of the eternal. We
have had such pleasure that we feel more good; we
issue grateful and earnest, happier, better men.
There have been sighs of regret that Beethoven did
not write more music like his Symphony in F; but
not only this movement, but these two first symphonies,
the sonatas in E flat, "Adelaide"&mdash;nay,
almost all his first period compositions. And here
our glances at this symphony must cease. The trio,
with its delicious strain, pleases us more than the
scherzo (a strain that might be made much more of).
The scherzo itself is less sympathetic than that of
No. 1: seems, in fact, rather heavily frolicsome. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
finale is a masterpiece, though decidedly inferior to the
first movements. Do composers often write their finale
when they are jaded? they should make this their
golden rule, <i>toutes les choses ont leur matinée</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="Symphony_No_III_Op_55" id="Symphony_No_III_Op_55"><span class="smcap">Symphony No. III., Op. 55.</span></a></h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"Lo Motor primo a lui si volge licto,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Soora tant'arte di natura, e spira<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Spirito nuovo, di virtù repleto"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>When we stand before this Symphony, like Death, it
"gives us pause"; it looms so great, so vast. It was
no wonder that it was not comprehended at first; and
this should be not a subject of regret, but gratification,
to the genius. Genius implies non-comprehension
at first, and all sorts of "cold obstruction"; and here
it may at once be said that, on the whole, genius, like
virtue, is its own reward, and perfect compensation
for all drawbacks. This should be borne in mind
when uncalled-for lamentations are, not unnaturally,
yet rather thoughtlessly made. Certainly, Beethoven
would not have been satisfied had this phenomenal
work, this prodigy, this spiritual Labour of Hercules
(type of all the great Helpers and Saviours of mankind),
been immediately grasped. To comprehend,
in some small measure, the prodigy called the Universe
around us, men and things have had to evolve for
countless ages; it is the same, on a miniature scale,
with individual works; and every poet rids himself of
his message in the great spirit of the great Kepler:&mdash;"I
may well wait a century for a reader, as God has
waited six thousand years for an observer." To no
man not rich in such a spirit will any great message
be whispered and entrusted.</p>

<p>Beethoven was, in his sphere, and with his vehicle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
of utterance, a prophet&mdash;a coming event that threw
its shadow before. He revealed to men, if they could
but have seen it, the Nineteenth Century&mdash;<i>its</i> inner
life, <i>plus</i> the nature and passions of the present (his
own day) and the past. No wonder, then, that the
men of his own day&mdash;the great mass, the local majority&mdash;could
not understand what really is a truer
mirror of us&mdash;our doubts, and fears, and struggles,
and hopes. And the <i>Sinfonia Eroica</i>, I take it, must
be so interpreted&mdash;in a spiritual sense (at least as
well as in the physical, or literal)&mdash;as much as the
Symphony in C minor, at least as much as the Pastoral
Symphony which Beethoven himself said was
really emotional rather than descriptive. And it little
matters whether or not Beethoven himself consciously
uttered these manifold messages of his in this or that
sense; he has as perfect a right as Shakespeare to be
deemed full of all that can be packed into him; nay,
it is all the better if he was <i>not</i> conscious: to repeat&mdash;unconsciousness
was the soul of his consciousness,
as it ever is, and must be, of all higher speech and
performance.</p>

<p>No mere battle, or ordinary warfare&mdash;certainly
Napoleonic&mdash;can adequately explain, is solely depicted
in, this grand work; though they become far
more satisfactory, so applied, when we consider them
as coarse manifestations of the higher qualities; in
fact, as backgrounds for and revelations of heroism.
By dwelling on this, we get nearer to the soul of the
symphony; spiritual warfare, rather, is what it proclaims.

Of Beethoven's notes, it may be quite as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
much said as of Luther's words&mdash;his notes are like
other men's battles. Better than any poem this
symphony (especially the first movement&mdash;<i>facile princeps</i>)
seems to hold the mirror up to Man in his Warfare,
specially and generally, physically and spiritually,
with and in his own inscrutable self, and with and in
the unspeakable elements of time. It is not without
special beauty, in the last but one, or Faust sense (we
were struck and pleased to come across Bendel's
words, corroborating our own notion, that Beethoven
was in some sort a Faust); and, before this symphony,
we feel Beethoven was that good man, struggling
with adversity, the spectacle of which is a benefit to
the very gods; and, under this feeling, the symphony
does us double good. The fact on the face of it is,
its Titanic power in <i>maturity</i>. The first two symphonies,
also rich in power, are stamped by a spirit
of youth. This gives them a delicious charm which
makes them extra dear; and which Beethoven himself
(let alone others) was fundamentally mistaken (we
feel) in underrating, nay, disparaging, as he was afterwards
wont to do (really, when his mighty powers
were waning, and he was perhaps in secret aware of
that; it is the common melancholy trick of men).
That peculiar spirit of freshness here at length we
seem to miss, or are no longer struck by. Here we
may draw the line. Here we see the ripe man, or
very nearly so; at least in the prime and plenitude of
his powers; not quite so <i>happy</i> as before, but
stronger; and as yet with no serious threatening
shadow of gloom&mdash;though there may be clouds "as
big as a man's hand," and even occasionally, perhaps,
hints, like the mole "cinque-spotted i' the bottom of
a cowslip," of tragedy and aberration among the
most melancholy in the history of men.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>Beethoven was an emphatically conscious, but
profoundly unconceited man. We are sure, therefore,
that he entitled his symphony "Heroic" (if he
did do so) with no unpardonable vanity; nevertheless,
we regret that (as also in his "Grand" sonatas)
he did not leave it to others&mdash;for itself to call itself
that. Truly, he did not exceed much in betitling and
programming&mdash;his sense of the infinitude of music
was too profound, of that as being <i>the</i> charm; but
even in the few cases where he did, perhaps the
breach would have been better than the observance.
One great disadvantage of betitling music is, that it
does not allow us to approach it afterwards without
preoccupation and convention; whereas, we should
approach it utterly free, except from our own nature,
and previous existence. Moreover, if the work correspond
ever so to the title or description, it is
discounted beforehand. To say <i>afterwards</i>, "that is
heroic!"&mdash;"this is pastoral!" is an added charm.
But to details.</p>

<p>It will at once be noticed that Beethoven begins
this symphony quite differently from its predecessors;
<i>allegro con brio</i>, two emphatic chords, and then <i>in
medias res</i>; the bass, however, leading off, as in No.
II., with, moreover, the same well-balanced poise
(delicate, yet firm as that of planet in its orbit),
springy step, and self-contained power. A characteristic
originality is the C sharp, where the bass
breaks off, hardly begun, and the</p>

<p class="center">"Upper air bursts into life,"</p>

<p>with glorious breadth and soaring&mdash;soaring to the
<i>primum mobile</i> through obstructive cloud (discords of
the dim. 7th on pedal tonic) with only increased
<i>éclat</i>! Thereupon, the basses worthily show forth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
the heroic confidence of the nobly unstudied theme&mdash;great
and gay with the certainty of final victory;
as it were, the warriors of Israel advancing to conquer
the Promised Land. Then, from none knows where&mdash;from
the very heart of heaven&mdash;fall shafts of light
indeed, as it were through the bosom of fragrance;
which exquisite strain, perhaps, contradicts what we
said about the absence of youth in this work. In any
case, it is one of those many melodies which so
movingly proclaim Beethoven a profoundly good
man, and how he wrote them so <i>from above</i>, or rather
they poured through him from infinite heights (depths
overhead) of ineffability. In this, in the <i>power</i> of his
sweetness, he has never been surpassed, hardly
equalled.</p>

<p>There are melodies by later men very beautiful too,
which seem, however, to come (we are almost tempted
to write) like certain later poetry, from a profoundly
<i>bad</i> source; they have demoniac, not divine beauty.
The strain in question:&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p>Certainly a</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Dolce melodia in aria luminosa,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>seems the spirit of Love itself pure and simple&mdash;as it
were, a glance from the "young-eyed cherubim" into
the Warrior's&mdash;into Beethoven's own heart. But, in
this "painfully earnest world," such blessedness cannot
long last, and the sunshafts are soon again
obscured in the smoke of battle&mdash;the mystic whisperings
drowned in the din of artillery. <i>Apropos</i>, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
struck us that, if we like the warlike figure, this
grand battlepiece (by Rubens? or Tintonello?&mdash;<i>Rembrandt</i>,
we would rather say) gains, if we consider it
as a <i>sea</i>-battle, in a storm, with wizard lights and
seams of fire all along the horizon. Nay, in the
second part&mdash;those wonderful strokes of genius
where the chord of the sub dominant (?) is piled on
to and clashes against that of the relative minor A&mdash;we
fancy it vividly depicting "Nelson falls!"
(the true hero, whose pole-star is duty; not pleasure,
nor ambition); and the unspeakable passage a little
further on (in E minor&mdash;Beethoven alone capable of
it&mdash;never dreamt of in the philosophy of his predecessors),
suggested his death&mdash;(or rather, more stupendously,
that of <i>the</i> Christian Hero, when He
"gave up the ghost," crying, "<i>Finitus est!</i>").</p>

<p>More than one modern work has attempted to
depict the world-old great subject: Virtue and Vice
contending for (or within) a human soul&mdash;the struggle
of Good and Evil. Methinks, as long ago as this
Heroic Symphony the same struggle is represented,
or shadowed forth (for its great text, like music in
general, and more so with Beethoven, has many
meanings). The third (?) subject in this theme-rich
movement, where Beethoven from his full heart
pours forth one motiv after another, is especially
suggestive of conflict&mdash;what shocks, clashes, contentions!&mdash;but
the "good angel fires the bad one
out," and bears the precious prize aloft in a whirl of
triumph&mdash;resounding, as it were, through the halls of
heaven&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Whose Titan angels, Gabriel, Abdiel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Starr'd from Jehovah's gorgeous armouries,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Rings to the roar of an angel onset."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>But then&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Me rather all that bowery loveliness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brooks of Eden mazily murmuring,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Whisper, in odorous heights, of even."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then we have a strain which seems to anticipate
Schumann himself, the greatest symphonist after
Beethoven&mdash;a singular repose, of almost unearthly
loveliness, after the high commotion.</p>

<p>&emsp;A little later, and <i>ecco!</i> a new idea:&mdash;</p>
<p class="center">
   <img src="images/p_043.jpg" width="300" height="101" alt="Music Score" /><br />
   <a href="music_files/p-043.mid">[Listen]</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>exquisite in its lightness and strength (like a giant at
play, or a river disporting in its banks); and thereupon,
after bold progressions, six remarkable iterations&mdash;also
like "So Fate knocketh at the portals!"
or like blow after blow of virtuous resolutions; where
all is characteristic, this is strikingly so. Then follows
another of his ineffable thoughts (supremely);
and then, after another whirl of the <i>sacred</i> fury, which
seems to be the soul of this unexampled movement,
we are brought back to the original subject, which
re-enters in its own colossal continence; and these
truly "<i>stupendi pagine</i>" (and not those about Goethe's
Frederika of Sessenheim, in his "Autobiography,")
are repeated. The second part, or elaboration (as it
is called) is likewise, and <i>par excellence</i>, stupendous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
especially the part before adverted to, in A and E
minor. Here, truly, the music quite transcends ordinary
language and thought; to bring ideas worthy
to it, we must recur to Him who cried "<i>Lama, Lama,
Eli Sabbacthani!</i>" This is the anguish of a Redeemer-soul.
But to such, also, is the victory; and
to such the Father sendeth legions of angels. See,
also, especially the passage further on, in G flat
(should it not be <i>andante</i>?)&mdash;which, as it were,
almost overcomes us with enchantment. Here, methinks,
the Invisible Auxiliaries already bear the poor
shell, and whisper at the same time a word of comfort
to the Mother&mdash;whom no Power strikes into stone,
like Niobe.</p>

<p>"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear!"&mdash;ears
that are but the outwork of the soul. Let him go,
even as it were, prepared and attuned, in some sort
like a Communicant&mdash;and receive music's banquet
mysteriously provided for him. The message of a
Beethoven is not trifling, but earnest; speaks inarticulately
(more divinely so) of the greatest, solemnest,
things; whispers and thunders from the Altar. If
"the value of no word is known till the greatest
master of it has arrived," so also the value of no
utterance is known till the greatest receiver&mdash;understander&mdash;of
it has arrived. Plato said, Poets speak
greater things than they know. Of none was this
ever truer than of Beethoven. He alone, in his day,
most knew the value and import of his music; others
come after (and will come) who know more. This is
his greatest praise. There is no more congenial
occupation to a sympathetic imagination than throwing
together some of the images, thoughts, or ideas
which his mighty music suggests. Goethe was displeased
when importuned for the key idea (<i>more Germanico</i>)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
of his "Wilhelm Meister;" thought that itself
should be sufficient of itself. It is the same with
Beethoven and this symphony. No <i>rigid</i> principle
must be sought, or insisted on. The first movement
especially does indeed stand very four-square and
homogeneous; but the fiery soul of it (sun-fire, passion
and beauty,) is very various in its manifestation;
and unless we understand and apply the term "heroic"
in its amplest sense, we are fettered and injured rather
than benefitted and helped. The greatest Hero we
yet wot of was personified self-sacrifice, love&mdash;who
did not flame abroad over that world a devastation,
but made his life answer the queries of philosophy,
and the doubts of the sceptic; the greatest Hero was
one who "went about doing good."</p>

<p>&emsp;Tennyson's eloquent alcaics on Milton&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O mighty-mouth'd inventor of harmonies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O skill'd to sing of Time or Eternity"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the rest of which have been already quoted, seems
not inapplicable to Beethoven and this his symphony.
Many others would do as well, or better. Of general
application&mdash;when we <i>think</i> of its melodious rush of
ideas (one of the distinguishing features between it
and the first two symphonies), great republican spirit
(in the highest sense), Sun-god beauty, and Jove-like
power; of its intellect, superior to that of Bach's (it
seems to us), as Carlyle well says Shakespeare's was
to that of the author of "<i>Novum Organum</i>," and of
its grace and sweetness, profounder than, not only of
Haydn's and Mozart's, but any other composer's, then
the beautiful words of Dante, at the head of this chapter,
may apply.</p>

<p>The Prime Mover turns joyfully unto him, and,
surpassing nature, breathes into him a new spirit,
replete with virtue and power.

</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Funeral March.</span></h4>

<p>Beethoven was a gloomily profound soul;&mdash;herein
differentiated from Shakespeare, who was pellucidly,
cheerfully profound; and unlike Schopenhauer (whom
he otherwise rather suggests), who was profoundly
gloomy&mdash;one of the most so who ever lived; therefore
he composed a "<i>Marcia Funèbre</i>" specially <i>con
amore</i>, and therefore it is specially characteristic of
him. In the present instance, this, as it were, unfathomably
profound inspiration, gains, as in every
other case, if we interpret it liberally rather than
literally, and consider it to depict and deplore rather
the death of a great Principle (such as Faith, Virtue,
Truth,) than a great man; or the great man, the hero,
<i>plus</i> the heroic, buried with him, <i>ultimus Romanorum</i>.
If we would realize the depths of this utterance&mdash;as
it were almost speechless&mdash;choked with tears&mdash;we
shall think of it in connection with such words as
the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Tired with all these, for restful death I cry&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As to behold desert a beggar born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And purest faith unhappily forsworn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gilded honour shamefully misplaced,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And strength by limping sway disabled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And art made tongue-tied by authority,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And folly (doctor-like) controlling skill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And captive good attending captain ill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tired with all these, from these I would be gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save that, to die, I leave my love alone."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Speaking of Schopenhauer, the difference between
him and Beethoven seems to be this:&mdash;the latter
shows us Optimism <i>victorious</i> over Pessimism; his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
works, indeed, seem specially and wonderfully to
mirror the struggle, as indeed, the whole of this
century at least is profoundly tinctured, nay seems
almost characteristically stamped by Pessimism; but
Beethoven does not, and will not give way to, and
end in the rayless paralysis of Pessimism; he fights
through, and soars triumphant; in Mr. Picton's
words, <i>re</i> Materialism, "comes out at the other side."
In this, methinks, the deadly struggle betwixt Optimism
and Pessimism around us and within us; but the
victory of the former, and the triumph of Immortality
over Doubt and Denial, we have the key to Beethoven's
music (of course unconsciously, and, as we
say, so much the better; it would have been worse
expressed had it been conscious). At a moment
when Pessimism was uppermost, he might have sat
down to write this Dead March: that it was to celebrate
Napoleon Buonaparte was never the case,
though it might have been to celebrate the Napoleon
of Beethoven's imagination, a <i>Hero</i>, to bewail whose
departure from among us no tones can be too pregnant
and profound, especially if we think we have
"fallen on evil times," and that we shall "never look
upon his like again." And here a word about Beethoven's
(the true hero) immortal act, when he heard
that Napoleon had made himself crowned&mdash;(the
other hero we spoke of refused a crown, and hid
himself); was not <i>that</i> a repudiation of Tyranny and
Quackery? was not <i>that</i> a royal piece of Iconoclasm?
to me it is one of the highest private scenes of History.
Summon it up one moment:&mdash;Beethoven's eye
flashing fire; the lion locks almost shaking flames,
as he tears the superscription in half (and Napoleon's
fame with it), and dashes the "carefully written out"
symphony on the floor, "put his foot down on <i>that</i>."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
<i>So</i>, I should like to see Beethoven painted; or still
better, sculptured. Dr. Nohl has taken occassion to
draw an elaborate parallel or comparison between
Beethoven and another great contemporary of his,
Goethe&mdash;(we would draw it also to the advantage of
the former;) Carlyle has done so, between Napoleon
and Goethe; we would do so between Napoleon and
Beethoven, and call the latter in our great Sage's
words, a "still white light shining far into the centuries,"
while the other was meteoric flame and volcanic
glare&mdash;not wholly, solely, for he too was an
instrument&mdash;an able, and necessary one, but in comparison.
Let anyone ask himself how he feels at the
mention of the two names. Is he not expanded,
cheered, comforted, and made better&mdash;unconsciously
made surer of goodness, truth, immortality, and all
high things, at the name of Beethoven; and is he
not repelled, if dazzled, by that of Napoleon? The
good was not buried with Beethoven's bones. Think
of the amount he has done after his death (like
Handel and his "Messiah"); think of his industrious
great life and character&mdash;so originally grand;
and contrast it with the portentous mass of lies and
murders, the conflagrations and widow's tears, the
hideous battle-fields of the heartless, semi-conscious,
semi-quack, diabolically selfish Napoleon, and the
good <i>he</i> has done after him. No! the good Wolfe
had rather have been Gray than the victor of Quebec,
and we would rather have been Beethoven than
Napoleon&mdash;whose very genius, moreover, is over-rated;
for we decidedly think with Madame de Stäel,
that had he met with an able and honest adversary
early, he would have been checked or defeated; nay,
he <i>was</i>, when he met Sydney Smith at Acre; and,
curiously enough, after, when he met <i>another</i> Briton,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
who was never defeated&mdash;Wellington. Napoleon
will always be marvelled at and written about, but it
will never be said of him&mdash;"in his works you will find
enrichers of the fancy, strengtheners of virtue, a
withdrawing from all selfish and mercenary thoughts,
a lesson of all sweet and honourable thoughts and
actions, to teach them courtesy, benignity, generosity,
humanity; for, of examples teaching these virtues,
his pages are full;"&mdash;as it was said of the author of
"Hamlet," and as it is here repeated of the mighty
composer of this "Dead March," with its wails from
the deepest and strains from the highest thing known&mdash;the
heart of man.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Scherzo.</span></h4>

<p>With a glance at the Scherzo, we will bring our
remarks to a close, the more especially as the Finale
seems less interesting, relevant, and original (Beethoven
seems more to have copied himself,) than the
rest.</p>

<p>The Scherzo, with its <i>obbligato</i> constituent element,
the "Trio," is on the same great scale, and in the
same epic spirit (we see no particular need, with
Wagner, to seek a connection,) as the first movement.
Here we <i>see</i> the gods and heroes, the immortals,
at sport in their own high hall&mdash;green-hill'd
theatre, and "deep-domed empyrean." Here Optimism
is not only victor, but full of play and humour.
Such Olympian sport, such great picturesque music,
was inconceivable to Beethoven's predecessors; and
we get some idea of his merit when we reflect that
the ground, when he began to write quartets and
symphonies, seemed already occupied, the sphere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
exhausted; and when we reflect, how, of all Haydn's
119 symphonies (!) not one, in some seasons, is
performed; whereas, Beethoven's are the feature of
almost every performance, and are found now to be
"favourite with all classes," as the Sydenham programme
asserts&mdash;a statement which, otherwise, rather
provokes an elevation of the eyebrows. The trio,
especially, is of exceeding original beauty; there are
few more grateful pages in Beethoven; none where
his peculiarly characteristic <i>healthy</i> sweetness (freshness-and-power&mdash;<i>depths</i>
of purity, beyond plummet's
sound,) is so strikingly, so enchantingly displayed.
At the base of a great mountain in Switzerland, with
his foot in two lakes, and with sides that might
almost have been an envy in Eden, there runs&mdash;from
one magical sheet of water to the other&mdash;a heavenly
valley. There we once saw a local military <i>Fest</i>,
with flying banners and echoing music; and, as we
walked along, under the eternal brow of that immense
emerald bastion, with the spring sun before us, we
thought of this Trio, and said&mdash;"Here is where it
ought to sound, by a noble army on its return, laurel-laden,
from righteous victory;" and Shakespeare's
lines again <i>festeggiavano</i> in the memory:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now is the winter of our discontent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made glorious summer by this sun of York;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the clouds that lower'd upon our house<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To the lascivious pleasing of a lute."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
How exquisitely we can fancy the horns making
those mountain-walls and woodlands ring! and the
hautboys in response, gladdening the pastures; while
the flutes (later) curl the wave; and the bassoons,
along with the other two epico-pastoral instruments,
after the maiden welcome of the violins&mdash;welcome
by maidens:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Oneste e leggiadre in ogni atto."&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Set all the bells a-ringing&mdash;over lake and lea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Merrily, merrily, along with them in tune."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is all enchanting; no greater epico-lyric poem in
Beethoven&mdash;who, even in the midst of this triumph
and beauty, cannot (thank inspiration!) but speak
from the profundities of him. I allude to that wonderful
passage where he brings in (hitherto reserved)
the clarinets (that voice of heroic women, as Berlioz
finds it), over the intensely expressive progression of
the strings, in response to the breathings of the horns.
In music perhaps there is no profounder interchange
of heart and soul, of sorrow and affection, touching
reminiscence from the lowest well-spring. This, perhaps,
is a glance at the "happy autumn days that are
no more;" or an heroic wail over the dead and desolated;
a glance back at the horrors of war&mdash;a thought
for the widows and orphans' tears falling even now
around; and yet, under all, a stern determination to
brook no tyranny, love of duty, and a high submission,
cost what it might, to the Supreme Will.</p>

<h3><a name="Symphony_in_B_Flat_No_4_Op_60" id="Symphony_in_B_Flat_No_4_Op_60"><span class="smcap">Symphony in B Flat, No. 4, Op. 60.</span></a></h3>

<p>This Symphony is only another proof of Beethoven's
kinship with Shakespeare. The terrible romance of
"Romeo and Juliet" (where the atmosphere seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
loaded with love and doom); the classic grandeur
of "Coriolanus" and "Julius Cæsar"; the passionate
intensity of "Othello"; the fearful sublimity
(depth, as well as height and breadth) of "Macbeth"
and "Lear;" the beautiful greatness of the "Tempest";
and the subtlety (seraphic, not demoniac),
tragic picturesqueness, inner life, and almost superhuman
power and insight of "Hamlet," are all, more
or less (and, indeed, more rather than less), to be
found reproduced in Beethoven; and truly, as it is
borne in on us, in him, the tone-poet, more than in
speech-poet, certainly more than in Schiller and
Goethe; more also than in our own men, of whom
none after Shakespeare can compare with Beethoven
except Milton&mdash;and him we reckon inferior. There
are indeed two elements of Shakespeare which Beethoven
lacks, his characteristic serenity and humour;
besides that, <i>Beethoven's tragedy is the tragedy of his own
soul, whereas Shakespeare wrote outside himself</i>. Beethoven
was a colossally subjective storm-tossed spirit
(though also eminently objective&mdash;none surpasses him
in broad vivid painting of images, as well as "the
life of the soul";)&mdash;the dove of whose ark (to speak
figuratively) never found soil for her foot after youth
had died out, and the flood fairly set in. But, in his
prime, also in the "April of his prime", and at his
best, he bears a greater family likeness to the great
ancestor than any other man, though he really resembles
no one but himself, just like Shakespeare,
as we feel after long but futile efforts to pair him with
somebody&mdash;a fact highly curious and interesting!
The kinship, however, is equally striking and fascinating;
and nowhere, perhaps, is it more fascinating
than in this B flat Symphony, which we are inclined
to term <i>par excellence</i> beautiful; as its predecessors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
are powerful and great. Indeed there seems something
of the opaline varnish&mdash;or rather, lustre, like a
leaf's&mdash;<i>from within</i>&mdash;of Mozart; specially beautiful,
as <i>he</i> is specially beautiful, and is not powerful or
great, profound and earnest, grand. But, again, <i>plus</i>
the grace, there is also, below, the characteristic
depth; after all, and as ever, power is <i>doch</i> the soul
of the beauty&mdash;as&mdash;and here is our point&mdash;in the
"Tempest" (and "Midsummer Night's Dream"), as
in Shakespeare, rather than in Mozart; indeed, we
know not but what Haydn's beauty has more a soul
of power.</p>

<p>The enchanting spirit of Shakespeare's fairy plays,
and the enchanting spirit world, seems that too of
this symphony. Here are Puck and Blossom, Oberon
and Titania; here are Ferdinand and Miranda&mdash;above
all, Ariel and Prospero. Prospero, whose
sublime spirit shines and rules in this inaugural
adagio&mdash;adumbration of Chopin (?) which dwarfs
Chopin indeed!&mdash;is much nearer akin to Schumann.
It is like an inspired dream (a Jacob's, or Elijah's, or
Daniel's). It seems a great foreshadowing of his
later style; in its vagueness it is vast&mdash;as it were, a
vestibule or forecourt of the Infinite, of higher life;
of that beyond, methinks, whereinto Prospero (our
own great dear, sad Beethoven, tired of all, and
of himself,) sinks his dreamy glance, when he casts
away for ever his magic wand (magic only in a lower
sphere, where life and character are inferior); "deeper
than did plummet sound," and cries, wrapt from the
bystanders:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>In the allegro we seem to continue our analogy&mdash;in
the wondrous isle itself (Isle of Formosa), "full of
strange sights and sounds." Here, not Greek Naiads
and Dryads, but Christian sprites and fairy-things,
or both in loving rivalry, flit and trip invisibly and
visibly; here is freshness! here are sunbeams! here
simplicity and sweetness (woodland and pastoral
beauty)! And if, in the matchless adagio the sea
murmurs round the "still-vext Bermoothes," and Ariel
fetches thence dew; here we have all-compelling
Prospero commanding the most exquisite airy sport&mdash;but
not for himself&mdash;but for the lovers.</p>

<p>The scherzo (to take that next), forces upon us
once more the question&mdash;how far did Beethoven, in
composing, draw upon his early treasures? This
delicious burst&mdash;or gush&mdash;of inspiration, as it were a
moment flashing over, might have been written in the
same spring months as that other delicious morsel&mdash;specially
cherished by us; the scherzo ("Allegro")
in E flat, in the early sonata of the same key&mdash;which
has always seemed to us the very breath of spring
itself&mdash;a page of nature in April. And why should
a Beethoven disparage his early works? were they
not <i>doch</i> the works of a Beethoven! Alas, he can
never be young again, never after equal them, for
their breath and spirit, for the April of their prime.</p>

<p>We should like to hear Liszt or Rubinstein play
this morsel arranged. It is as delicate as Heller
(whom it indeed anticipates) and Mendelssohn, and
strong as Wagner;&mdash;but nay, Beethoven will compare
only with himself. It is originally exquisite and exquisitely
original. It has, too, the same magical, nay,
mystical beauty whose glamour is over all this musical
mirror of the "Tempest." The imaginative Sonata
in D minor, which Beethoven himself referred to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
enchanting drama&mdash;especially the first movement&mdash;reflects,
I take it, the deeper bases and significance
of the poem; tempest-tossed man, with his cries to
the Unknowable, almost like a wounded animal, and
rays of sunshine pouring still through storm; man,
at war with the elements and himself, the elements
without and within him; man, so little on this stupendous
stage; man, so great with his alone-perception
of it; man, so mean and hateful in his baser
parts, so colossal, so divine in his higher; so low as
animal (lower than they), so high as hero and sage.
Indeed, the tremendous conflict of outer and inner
life, this appalling discrepancy we seem to meet with
everywhere; man's struggle with nature, and the
struggle of both with themselves, seems to be the
inner picture both of Shakespeare and Beethoven&mdash;especially
the latter, who was a mighty brooding fermenting
soul&mdash;how far transcending our Byron and
his "Manfreds"!&mdash;more allied to "Faust," yet
greater, nobler, dearer, difficult to arrive at harmony
with others and himself ("perplext in faith, yet pure
in deeds"), who seems happy only in the first part of
his progress (expedition, undertaking, crusade), and
victorious in the middle; and whom, alas! we fancy
almost as despairing of solving the problem (<i>é pure
troppo per me</i>) in the end, and going down in the
tempest&mdash;yet, like the traditional Vengeur, with guns
all shooting, and flag at the mast-head flying, and
glorified in the setting sun.</p>

<p>I will not dwell on the finale, but conclude with
some fancies suggested by the rarely beautiful adagio&mdash;like
a lovely bird from another world, like the
ph&oelig;nix new born. Here is what Elterlein says of
the finale:&mdash;"The truly phantastic, airy, sprite-like
(<i>elfenartige</i>), at times even boding twilight" (the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Scotch uncanny gloaming would more approach the
original, <i>Unheimlicht Düstere</i>&mdash;Scotch, by the way,
would often marvellously translate German&mdash;they
have a mass of expressive words which we have not)&mdash;"boding
twilight, nay, wild culminates, however,
only in the fourth movement. How light and vanishing
do these tone-pictures hover and pass, what
characteristic glooming (<i>Helldenkel</i>) does
not envelope this scene too."</p>

<p>Of course, this symphony cannot compare one
moment with the Eroica and C minor, for grandeur,
opulence, and power; but it is a lovely interlude,
giving us a divine moment of gratification and repose&mdash;an
Italian spring day by a lake, to a tropical one,
with its Himalayas and interwoven forest, "like a
cathedral with service on the blazing roof."</p>

<p>And now for the adagio! which I will only preface
by this admonition, always to be recollected; viz.,
that whatever fancies or figures music may suggest,
and however the abstract terms&mdash;such as sweet, tender,
vigorous, grand, &amp;c.&mdash;may, and must be applied
in common to all composers, yet each composer has a
special individuality; and <i>the music that suggests the
figures and fancies, the ideas, has, apart from this, for
ever a special charm of its own</i>, which cannot be lost,
nor yet transcribed. To those who do not, and to
those who do approve the fancies, this charm <i>per se</i>
remains.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><a name="The_Adagio" id="The_Adagio"><span class="smcap">The Adagio.</span></a></h4>

<p>A work of supererogation, the adagio is still sometimes
executed at concerts, which rejoices in the
sensational title of "Le trille du Diable;" founded,
it is said, on a dream of the composer's (Tartini);
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
this, simply-named "Adagio," of Beethoven's, then&mdash;in
considering which, I mean to surrender myself
wholly to poetry&mdash;might be a reminiscence of his
of music, in a dream, by the angel, Gabriel; or such,
for instance, as might have escorted the seraph when
he descended, and said, "<i>Ave Maria!</i>"&mdash;or it might
be an unconscious reminiscence of previous existence
of the great and good man; or the strain the Shepherds
heard, in the field, watching their flocks by
night&mdash;again, and more specially, a</p>

<p class="center">"Dolce melodia in aria lumino,"</p>

<p>through the purple air, mingled with ambrosia, and
the beams of <i>that</i> evening star. Nay, it might have
lulled that head which had nowhere to rest, when
perchance it <i>did</i> find some rocky corner; or Saul of
Tarsus, or Jonah below on the raging sea. It puts us
in mind of the immortal line&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"After life's fitful fever, he sleeps well."</p>

<p>Ah! we see therein the great weary spirit of its own
eternal messenger, for once at least, rocked on its waves
and soothed by its balm, in the sea of immortality. It
is a pleasure to throw together all the ideas with which
it inspires us. It seems a foretaste of Schumann and
Ernst ("Elegy"); it has their glimmering romance,
and Beethoven's own peculiar profound sweetness,
<i>not</i> tainted (at least here and yet) by anything morbid,
or the suspicion of it. It, too, suggests earlier years&mdash;"<i>Ach!</i>"
a reminiscence of childhood in Rhineland.
It is glamorous, but with the glamour of
Ariel&mdash;a spirit of good&mdash;the spirit of Shakespeare.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
It is tender and beautiful as Jean Paul; deep, sweet,

<p>Beethoven might well write an Heroic Symphony,
for the very soul of his symphonies is heroism. He
<i>named</i> one "heroic," but he <i>wrote</i> many, including the
sonatas, which are unfortunately limited to the piano,
whose powers they utterly transcend. Heroism is
the soul, and antagonism the substance, through which
heroism ultimately fights its way. Beethoven is the
Hercules of music (Hercules was in some sort also
the Pagan Christ), undertaking labours for men's
emancipation and help; beating Hydros down; conquering
all sorts of opposition&mdash;unconquerable except
by love; and, like the antique hero, alas! with an
end as tragic. Such comparisons we are obliged to
have recourse to, to explain Beethoven's music&mdash;its
might and significance. "What, then, does this
eternal conflict, and victorious heroism storming
through, mean?" Ah! how they still paint the
conflict of rule and anarchy, of the intellect and
reason, of passion and prejudice!</p>

<p>Man is called the microcosm of nature, and music
is the microcosm of man; <i>his</i> antagonism and
heroism, internal as well as external, are herein
mirrored. Music is the highest art; because the
most spiritual, infinite, self-existent (creating, not
copying), and comprehensive. No statue, picture,
or pile, can compare with the power of a symphony&mdash;which,
indeed, all but rivals that of nature herself,
of the great world and starry heavens; the secret of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
whose power is also the Infinite, with its whispered
promise&mdash;its soul&mdash;Immortality. Art is the shadowing
forth of the infinite: music does this most, and
Beethoven's is most music. Music, as we said, is the
microcosm of man. As the world is comprised in
him&mdash;alone realized <i>by</i> him, and therefore in some
sort alone existent <i>in</i> him, so are his nature and
history comprised in music&mdash;his depths and heights,
beauties and deformities, aspirations and passions,
circumstances and powers. It is the "might, majesty,
and dominion," inarticulateness, <i>profound</i>
beauty&mdash;as it were searching flower-cups with star-beams:
the effluence of a soul deep as heaven
(beyond the other side of earth)&mdash;of man (not "<i>etwas</i>,"
of a man) that Beethoven shadows forth. That one,
also, who struggled in the womb&mdash;what was he but a
type of man in the all-comprising womb of nature?
And this, also, Beethoven's music suggests; not least
the music of this stupendous symphony&mdash;only another
"Eroica," and greater, without the name (better so).
<i>More suo</i>, Beethoven himself flashed a meaning more
or less on it. "So knocketh Fate at the portal;"
yes! with the portentousness of the "knocking at
the gate" (see Lamb's remarks), in "Macbeth;"
yes! fate in the form of duty. And truly, what
higher subject&mdash;subject dear to the ancients as they
are called&mdash;subject constantly treated in his own
inspired way (Nature's), by Shakespeare&mdash;could be
chosen? And Beethoven has rivalled Aiskulos and
Shakespeare. Here is battle! here is victory!&mdash;here,
too, the air seems almost oppressive with love and
doom; and here, too, in the background, and from
the deepest deeps, are wreaths and similes of celestial
beauty. "Well done, good and faithful servant;
enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." Another thing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the first movement suggests is, that it is the greatest
of "<i>Dies Iræ</i>." That passage, especially on the
second page of the second part, where one half the
orchestra answers the other with the same terrific
unisons&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(<i>en passant</i>, did ever reiteration play such a part?),
prompts the wildest fancies. We think of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"The glooms of hell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Echoed with thunder, while the angels wailed;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>or again, echoes of deserted hell on the day of doom&mdash;the
fiends summoned to the judgment-seat. But let
us recur to Beethoven's more human suggestion.
Fate knocketh in the form of Duty; Promethean free-will,
human passion, rebels and struggles for a time,
but at last yields; and heroic resolve is triumphant&mdash;heroic
love. For, "Ach!" methinks these terrible blows
are indeed those of Fate; but also those, viz., which
nailed Heroic Love (comprehend both words) to the
cross&mdash;heroic love that made even</p>

<p class="center">"Destiny coincide with Choice;"</p>

<p>&mdash;that from the horrible instrument of torture and death
itself, cried, "Father! forgive them, for they know
not what they do;" and in the midst of the greatest
of struggles and temptations (viz., with himself),
wrestled and conquered, and cried, "Not my will
(the local), but Thine (the universal) be done."&mdash;Such
is the colossal difference between the pictures
of Christ submitting, and Prometheus cursing the
gods.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact, that this symphony is so
great&mdash;indeed, the greatest; and yet, it is a fact
fundamentally, instructively natural; for, not premeditating
it beforehand, Beethoven sat down to
write about the greatest thinkable subject out of his
inmost own heart&mdash;nay, as it were, with his own
heart's blood. Another remarkable fact is, that the
so much abused public soon realized that this symphony
was the greatest. This symphony paints
Beethoven's life&mdash;especially inner life&mdash;which "life"
properly means. Here we see genius struggling
with fate, in which his life was sunk (like every life);
wherewith our little life is rounded, as with a sleep.
Fate! What had it done for Beethoven? What does
it mean?</p>

<p>In the first place&mdash;mysteriously great fact&mdash;Fate
had from the outset given him her own answer, had
put into his hands <i>the</i> weapon for defeating her, viz.,
Genius. Armed with this, he can bide his time, and
take all the drawbacks <i>plus</i>; especially as with him
genius implies, what, properly, it always implies,
Valour&mdash;or, in the valuable Latin double-sense or
many-sense of the word, Virtue. The drawbacks&mdash;disagreeables,
obstacles, from drunken father, aye, and
own character, downward&mdash;in no wise fail to come.
Amongst the gravest are the physical, deafness; one
mixed, unsatisfied heart; and one spiritual, unsatisfied
soul&mdash;all sunk in the adamantine environment
of Fate. But then, as observed, Fate equips her
adversary for the battle. And mark how Beethoven
quits himself in the encounter. In early morning, in
the burden and heat of the day, and by declining
sun, he&mdash;like every true man, (like the Son of Man,
or Brother of Man)&mdash;fights Fate with his life;
makes his <i>life</i> answer doubts; and queries; and despair,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
the crucial questions which Fate forces on him.
It is in this sense Emerson's saying applies. Beethoven
thus answered questions he was not conscious
enough to put; as, on the other hand, he also put
questions he had not the power to answer&mdash;like the
nineteenth century itself&mdash;questions which the twenty-ninth
will probably be seeking a solution for. When
Fate buffeted Beethoven at home (bitter mockery!), he
worked in the direction, and with the instrument,
which nature gave him; when she appeared as grim
<i>Vièrge de Fer</i>, commanding him to earn his bread,
he worked; when she appeared (more cruelly) as
syren (mocking him), he worked (not went away and
rioted); when&mdash;the most unkind cut of all&mdash;she
made him deaf (him, Beethoven the grandest representation
of man for the constituency, Music), he
worked harder than ever; and all through the time,
down to the end, <i>when</i> he could not, <i>though</i> he could
not, satisfy the most irrepressible and unsatisfiable of
all inquirers, his own unsettled soul&mdash;incapable of
<i>grasping</i> eternity, <i>knowing</i> it must exist; incapable of
<i>proving</i> immortality, feeling it is the very breath of
life and beauty, and must be&mdash;from first to last, he
worked. For this, he could dispense with going to
hear Immanuel Kant; though, assuredly, their understanding
of the "Categorical Imperative" was one,
viz., Conscience(?). "Two things strike me dumb,&mdash;the
heavens by night, and the moral law in man."
Let Fate knock as she may,&mdash;unannounced, her
loudest, long-sustained&mdash;as in these portentous notes
(was ever chord of the dim. 7th so treated&mdash;so
inspiredly?):&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
   <img src="images/p_063.jpg" width="400" height="137" alt="Music Score" /><br />
   <a href="music_files/p-063.mid">[Listen]</a>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>
<p>in these notes&mdash;whose indefinite dwelling seems to
say, "I pause for a reply." Fate confronts man&mdash;a
being <i>repleto di virtù</i>; a being bound by will, but
with an unique sense of freewill: here she meets
consciousness-and-conscience. Her blows are hard;
but "a soft answer (the <i>p</i> ensuing) turneth away
wrath"&mdash;Beethoven turns her blows (<i>her</i> blows) into
beauty. I am also here struck by the reflection,
that we may consider these as the blows of death
(<i>cum æquo pede</i>)&mdash;<i>that</i> form of fate; and they are
answered by the soft whisper&mdash;"immortality." This
soft whisper rises into storm-loudness, at its grandest
(further on), that is, where man cries, "Aye, and
though personal immortality be a vain dream, I will
be immortal here, and thus answer thee, thou bug-bear,
Death! Suffice it for me to be here great and
good!"</p>

<p>Mark especially, somewhat further on, after the stormy
passage, the strain in the major (E flat). I have no
words for its beauty (especially if played <i>andante</i>); it
is like star-dew fallen into the bosom of a lily. Or,
again, "deep answering unto deep," he rises and
strikes her back with power. Every depth into
which her blows fell him, only confers on this Antæus
new power. Though o'er him, in the words of the
Greek Beethoven (Aiskulos&mdash;in the Greek Macbeth,
Agamemnon)&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Billow-like, woe rolls on woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the light of heaven,"<br /></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>&mdash;to use our own poet's magnificent image&mdash;(type, as
here applied, of character; or of immortality&mdash;the
eternal hope of it in man). Such we figure the conduct
of this Titan in the stupendous conflict&mdash;Titan,
who made the very gods tremble:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<span class="smcap">Fialte.</span>&mdash;La nome; e fece le gran prove,<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">"Soleva la lancia<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>to quote the <i>Italian</i> Beethoven; the spear of Achilles,
and his father, heals its wounds. The cruel blows of
Fate and Temptation (to error and despair) are resisted,
cured, and beaten, as before said, by her own
gift, or by herself, in the form of character and genius.
In the light of the higher reading before-mentioned,
Fate, under the terrible but divine form of duty (divine
necessity), knocks at man's heart, and bids it open;
but that being human&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"Frailty, thy name is Man,"&mdash;</p>

<p>hesitates, protests, rebels, in all the strength of selfish
passion, of full-armed nature. As before thrown out,
the grand lesson (whatever dialect man may speak or
think), the tremendous spectacle, is in the Garden of
Gethsemane and in Golgotha. Thither we must
repair, if we would realize the force of this idea&mdash;of
this music. In the light of morning we have once
again played it (<i>gewiss</i> not like a Rubinstein), and
find our words no whit too strong (after orchestral
performance one is simply overpowered). We are
struck with the impression that it is the most dramatic
work, not only in music, but human performance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
(no painting, even, can so evoke all the feelings
of the Cross); and we would use the higher imaginings
we have to give our brother musicians an idea
of the true greatness, the sacred grandeur, of their
art: it knows no rival but poetry.</p>

<p>Let us, then, with a final glance at that stupendous
drama, close. Fate, in the thunder-pregnant darkness,
over all the cypress-bowers and cedar-glooms,
"commends" the fearful chalice to the lips. Ensues
the highest of struggles&mdash;godlike; but, finally, with
the most immortal of earth's words, Character, the
softly invincible heroism of self-sacrificing love, the
grandeur of filial submission to the Universal Will,
conquers; and a strain of seventh-heaven triumph
bears away the words&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Father</span>, not my will, but
Thine be done!" It is the same in the fell scene of
Golgotha. As we said, these blows are the nails
driven home; <i>but they cannot nail down the spirit</i>;
and the spouting blood is a fountain of glory; the
cross by magic, made the highest symbol of men.
Fate may do her worst now&mdash;from without or within;
temptation was trampled under foot; and, lo! Fate
is conquered!&mdash;or rather, one with apotheosis and
immortality.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><a name="The_Andante" id="The_Andante"><span class="smcap">The Andante.</span></a></h4>

<p>I recollect reading, some one exclaimed, in natural
rapture on hearing this andante of andantes
(the only rival of the sonata theme in A flat&mdash;?) "Oh!
what must that man have felt who wrote this!" Yes;
felt when he wrote it, and all through life. What
inner life was not his! "It comes before me," as the
Germans say, that this movement should be played
before the distant sea, in the westering sun of a summer's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
day. Methinks, on its heavenliest of dreams,
in view of that suggested sea of immortality, Beethoven's
own spirit might pass away; had a sanctioned
longing so to do; not in misanthropic disgust (nothing
Byronic, <i>à la</i> Manfred) but at peace&mdash;with all, all.
This is the celestial <i>Nunc Dimittis</i>: the life and worship,
including work, in the temple&mdash;this infinite&mdash;is
over; the Messiah is come; higher life dawns upon
men&mdash;therefore, "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant
depart in peace!"</p>

<p>It is impossible to express, only possible in some
sort to feel, the unfathomable peace shadowed forth
in this music. Or, again, it is a <i>Kinderscene</i>, greater
than any of any Schumann. As for "Songs without
words," they are tinsel to it. Here is a reverie by
one of the highest, dearest, of men, from the summit
where he first sees his shadow slope towards the
grave, back into the holy dreamland of childhood.
Here is its mystic infinitude reflected and shadowed
forth by a heart that almost dies in the process
for yearning and love. <i>Dies heisst Sehnsucht, dies
Liebe!</i></p>

<p>If Shakespeare, in his marvellous serenity, implies
all the storms fought out beforehand (a description
difficult to mend); here we have, at least, "the
Peace of God which passeth understanding" (is
superior to&mdash;as Goethe reads it&mdash;as well as, baffles),
when they <i>have</i> been fought out by the man, the sight
of whom struggling with adversity (inner as well as
outer, faults of character as well as blows of fate)
benefits the gods. Here we have a spirit sunk in
such peace as Petrarch's departed Laura speaks of&mdash;</p>

<p>storm-tossed soul, buffeted spirit, out of harmony

and annoys of earth); but of whose profoundest heart
in compensation he knew the deepest secret, in
whose bosom's centre he nestled (in his happy hours),
repairing thither from the disgusts and battles of the
world, or expatiating in the blessed hope of everlasting
life, after the raging conflict of doubts and
queries, to whose inmost holy of holies he penetrated,
and was welcomed; he, the wayward child&mdash;to
extend the idea&mdash;leaving all his toys, and running in
a passion of sobs to the Eternal Bosom, with a more
peculiar smile than that other who dwelt for ever in
its courts, or lingered round his mother's (the Madonna's)
knee; for Mozart I fancy the Mother's
favourite, Beethoven the Father's; o'er Mozart's music

<p class="center">"<i>Quando Giove fu arcanamente giusto.</i>"<br />
"<i>Ich glaube, nur Gott versteht unser Musik.</i>"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These two mottoes, from Dante and Jean Paul,
give some sort of expression to the feelings excited
by this music&mdash;music which makes rather premature
that offer of a premium for a new epithet, at Symphony,
No. 2. And yet it is distinctly the same
Beethoven here, only full grown; not only serpent-strangling,
but hydra-killing and labour-doing Hercules.
Jove, left for ever the society of the nymphs,
and speaking from the central throne, <i>orcanamente
giusto</i>. One is certain, Beethoven himself could not
have <i>explained</i> this music; there is such a mysterious
pregnancy in it, such a holy ominousness (if not
played too fast), such a shadowy sorrow, such other-world
tones of pathos and resolution and triumph.
This is a message the prophet does not dream of
daring to try and comprehend; an utterance which
oracle itself would never attempt to explain.
This is the sort of music Jean Paul alluded to, when
he declared that it was above our own understanding,
clear only to the Divine. This is the sort of music
which might illustrate his sublime utterance, "Women
are beautiful, because they suffer so much." Here
(once more), we have the Invisible Host chaunting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
in almost appalling mournfulness round the cross,
or the tomb&mdash;"It is over; it is over. The Man of
Sorrows, and acquainted with grief! Thus have they
'done to death' their Highest among them!" But
then&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>ensues such high retrospect and encouragement&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"Love bears it out even to the end of doom;"</p>

<p>then such angelic clamour of triumph&mdash;"O grave,
where is thy victory! O death, where is thy sting?"
This, too, is a walk "over the field of battle by night"
(Marx, <i>re</i> the Funeral March, <i>Eroica</i>); but it is another
battle-field than a Napoleonic one&mdash;the world is the
field, and Heroic Love has gone down on it, like a
cloven star at sea. The world is the field, and the
highest and the lowest in us doing battle therein,
amidst heaps of slain. Poor humanity!</p>

<p>It has been a fearful conflict. What do we not
deplore? But, lo! as the infernal volumes roll
sluggishly away, as though loth to quit the hateful
banquet, high above all an unspeakable orb shines
through, the orb of promise and peace. "Ach!"
poor man, there is enough, indeed, to root pessimism
in thee; evil seems to have nestled in every pore;
life seems to try how hard she can make it to live;
thou thyself shudderest at thy self; art tortured by
appetites, goaded by passions, infested by thoughts,
distracted by doubts, almost driven to despair. But,
no! do <i>not</i> despair. Progress is slow, but sure. All
is justified at last; and higher life lightens in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
dawn. Nay, even if thy dearest hope be a dream&mdash;that
word too great for any mouth, Immortality&mdash;be
good (great and strong) <i>here; that</i>, if not so happy, is
a still higher immortality&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then what could death do, if thou should'st depart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving thee living in posterity?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In such a sea of thoughts&mdash;such a thousand-path'd
forest&mdash;does Beethoven's music plunge us; such a
branching piece of the Infinite is it. For the rest,
apart from ideas and images, the mere notes have an
eternal self-charm. Who fore-ordered this collocation
and sequence? Who suggested these harmonious
mysteries? How minor and major here phrase and
fall together! Never did they do so before; rarely
will they do so again. Beethoven was a divine
kaleidoscope in a divine hand.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>fugato</i> page takes us into another order of
ideas. Here it would almost seem as though tragedy,
which threatened to take entire possession of the
spirits, were shaken off, and cheerful activity resumed.
Here we seem to have the chase, or a military <i>festival</i>,
or the resolute alacrity which precedes a patriotic
war. The climax, those <i>klingende</i> concords, in C <i>alt.</i>,
are very fresh and brilliant; and the imitation is a
very interesting characteristic bit of Beethoven (proof
amongst many that he studied Handel, if he studied
anybody); nevertheless, though the resumption of the
original inspired motive is simply grand (peculiar to
Beethoven), a slightly uncomfortable feeling is occasioned
by this music, in juxtaposition with its predecessor.
A certain violence seems done to us; we
feel "Is not this rather an incongruous intercalation?"
Contrast it certainly is, and excellent in itself; but,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
had it not been better to have left it out altogether?
nay, to have been content with the wonderful allegro
as it stood&mdash;in those continent bars sublime, and
not to be eclipsed. Are we not here too suddenly
transported from sub-tropical to temperate zone; or,
rather, from some undiscovered inter-world, where is
the highest discourse on the</p>

<p class="center">
"Issues of Life and Death"<br />
</p>

<p>to every-day life? In any case, the music is curiously
lighter than the preceding; nay, almost suggests the
thought that Beethoven might have here made use of
a more youthful idea. And, in strict justice, we must
say, it is below the level&mdash;if not, indeed, unworthy of,
incompatible with, this stupendous symphony. In
one word, it does not seem to exist of inner necessity
(the eternal test), like its marvellous predecessor:
it was written, but not inspired.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This, rather than, as Marx says, the last movement
of Symphony No. 2, might be designated the finale of
finales (?)&mdash;"The most sublime chaunt of triumph
ever pealed forth by an orchestra." <i>Multum in parvo</i>
I have put a mark against the D, because that one
touch (of nature) makes all the difference; nay, I had
almost said, stamps the passage. Substitute a B, and
the emphasis is lost, together with the originality.
Nevertheless, the movement is hardly of equal value
throughout; it has its "worser half;" and is also,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
unfortunately, too long. As in so many other cases,
ideas are repeated, repeated already. But this is not
the worst; the worst is, that the overwhelming effect
of the stupendous burst is seriously impaired. It
should have</p>

<p class="center">"Smitten once, to smite no more."</p>

<p>This terrible "elaboration," so superfluously "necessary";
such a fancied <i>sine quâ non</i>! Here, we
must seriously repeat the protest against the conventional
custom; nay, almost raise the question, whether
it is not rather a reproach to Beethoven (the original)
that he did not get out of this thoughtless old groove.
Here, the idea did not extrude the form, but rather
<i>con</i>formed to it; was, as it were, poured into the
traditional mould. But the form should be the eventuation
of the idea, of the germ-soul ("<i>pensiero di
Dio</i>"), as in a living organism (tree, <i>e.g.</i>, or man).
<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
With regard to the "worser half" we ventured to
speak of, it is simply, as in so many cases, even in
Beethoven himself, and notably (as we have so often
felt) in the <i>Lieder ohne Worte</i>; there, very rarely is
the second motive equal to the first; the first
<i>was motive</i>&mdash;the "germ-soul," inner necessity of
the piece, <i>perforce</i> giving birth to it; the second
was factitious. In the present case, does not this
subject&mdash;</p>

<p>seem really trifling (nay, almost jiggy) by the side of
the grand opening, so broad and victorious? We are
rather reminded of that traditional movement, whose
ambling hilarity is our special horror, viz., the Rondo&mdash;we
hope by now decently dead and buried; nay, we
think, too, of the Sonata in G (Op. 31). This
unlucky subject seems to us as unworthy its glorious
predecessor as the last movement of that sonata is
unworthy of the first&mdash;that burst of inspiration, like
water from the rock, rolling on into broad <i>Symphonische
Dichtung</i>. (In the course of the present <i>motiv</i>,
consecutive octaves are prominent). A little further
on&mdash;one bar and a half, true Beethoven, is worth a
page of such undignified <i>Tonspiel</i>. It is one of those
bars which convey a "shock of delight" whenever
they catch the musician's eye&mdash;</p>

   <a href="music_files/p-074a.mid">[Listen]</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Few pleasures could be more elegant than to extend
such an idea <i>ad lib.</i> as an andante on the organ. (We
can imagine its effect as a prelude in some old rural
church&mdash;say on a mellow Sunday afternoon).</p>

<p>Another notable point is, the "grinding out" (long
before Berlioz) of the minor second against the tonic;
an effect of extraordinary resolution and power&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>eloquently expressive, indeed, of a determination to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
bear it out against the shocks of doom. In this and
other traits, we have the true Beethoven&mdash;such
spiritual energy as (except in Handel, and with him
it was less human) had not yet been dreamt of; such
suffering in strife, and yet such glorying in it; such
temptations in the wilderness (of his own heart, as
well as elsewhere); such final victorious success!
And, here we are brought back into our old more
genial vein and strain; we forget the spots on the
sun, and lose ourselves in his overpowering effulgence.
This "<i>erhabensten Triumphgesang</i>" is, to us,
that of resurrection; when the ponderous lid was
burst from within with light, which at once&mdash;so the
great fancy expatiates&mdash;redoubled the splendour of
day all over the world. Handel's selected words&mdash;nay,
and very remarkably, the great flash-of-chorus
itself (one could, indeed, imagine it as having suggested
Beethoven's, they are so much alike)&mdash;come into the
mind,&mdash;</p>

<p>In Teutonic language, which finds in the highest
imaginings only the symbol and apotheosis of human
worth and endeavour; which believes, indeed, that
by man came and comes the resurrection from the
dead; and which regards that life as the most priceless
page in human history, to be for ever applied
and interpreted by sympathy at will; and first
becoming truly divine when we regard it as truly
human&mdash;in Teutonic thought and dialect, we will conclude
with this eloquent and intrinsic application to
the greatest of Beethoven's symphonies:&mdash;"Nohl
names the work the musical Faust of the moral will
and its conflicts; a work whose progress shows that
there is something greater than Fate, namely, Man,
who, descending into the abysses of his own self,
fetches counsel and power wherewith to battle with
life; and then, re-inforced through his conviction of
indestructible oneness with the god-like, celebrates,
with dythyrambic victory, the triumph of the eternal
Good, and of his own inner Freedom."</p>

<p>"Here (in Heiligenstadt, near Vienna, in the
summer of 1808, lying by the brook with nut-trees,
listening to the birds singing), I wrote the 'Scene
by the Brook,' and the goldhammers there up
above me, the quails and cuckoos round about me,
helped compose."&mdash;Beethoven to Schindler. These
last words throw a light on the oft-abused passage
where the birds are imitated. We should not judge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
a Beethoven hastily&mdash;especially not assign to his
action low grounds. We here see that the passage
was not introduced in mere material imitation, but
rather as a genial tribute and record; <i>so</i> the passage
becomes beautiful, and the opposite of superficial.
Emerson says, "Yon swallow weaving his straw into
his nest should weave it into my poem." No doubt,
in the savage&mdash;in his passionate love of freedom and
roaming&mdash;we already find the germ of the poetic love
of nature; and some two thousand years ago we
find such sublime celebration as this (and what ages
of evolution does it imply!)&mdash;</p>

<p>In the sister arts&mdash;sister graces&mdash;painting and music,
down to Turner and the Turner of music, Beethoven
(he also would have given us the Python slaying
Apollo, and the going home of the Teméraire, the
Plague of Darkness, Æneas leaving Carthage, and
Italy, Ancient and Modern: Schumann, too, is very
Turner-like, perhaps more so, has more of that mystical
glamour&mdash;Beethoven, like Rembrandt, only
ideal); in the sister arts, Nature could not fail to be
celebrated, or rather let us say ideally reproduced,
and even transfigured, through the geniuses of these
arts, her eldest children&mdash;nay, herself (made man).
In Beethoven, then&mdash;a tone-poet, German, and <i>born
on the Rhine</i>, at, perhaps, its grandest part&mdash;as we
might expect, this worship and celebration of nature,
this apotheosis in tone, culminates. Her sweetness
and her grandeur, coloured, too, by his own Beethoven-soul,
are by him sublimely revealed&mdash;in many a
page and passage dear to the sympathetic knower.
It was, then, impossible that Beethoven should <i>not</i>
write (betitled or not) a Pastoral Symphony; and this,
if only as one manifestation of his (like nature) many-sidedness.
Moreover, though the Greek poesy reads
as fresh as if written yesterday, nevertheless nature-worship,
such as we understand it&mdash;an overpowering
sense of her mysticism, a rapturous <i>losing</i> of ourselves
in her&mdash;seems a thing not only specially Teutonic and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
modern, but modern even among the Teutonic peoples
themselves, dating after the Reformation; and, indeed,
almost as though nature-worship was to supply the
place of religion (in the narrow sense, worship of an
anthropomorphic maker of nature), rapture in her to
supply the place of religious rapture, no longer possible;
if so, a beautiful ordinance! Hence, then, if
we go a little way below the surface, the present
masterpiece, Beethoven's universally favourite (though
far from greatest, indeed, the Symphony in D is
superior&mdash;much more powerful, especially the first
movement, and at least equally fresh) "Pastoral
Symphony." It does not, indeed (at least the opening
allegro), celebrate that peculiar, that sacred sentiment
we have been speaking of; it does not utter
the unutterable, but it is a true and lovely nature-poem
nevertheless, worthy of all acceptation; without
it the splendid series of symphonies would have been
incomplete. Let us approach it.</p>

<p>What <span class="smcap">Strikes</span> us in this "household-word" work,
especially in the first movement, is its significant simplicity.
It is wonderful, as revealing to us how
<i>profoundly</i> simple a great man can be, and is; sublime
in that, as well as in his opulence and power; indeed,
simplicity is an inevitable concomitant and <i>sine quâ
non</i> of power; even in a Napoleon, let alone a Shakespeare,
a Newton, and a Beethoven.</p>

<p>So simple is the allegro, that it almost seems studiously
so&mdash;almost as though Beethoven thereby
wished to convey a reproach, at least a monition, to
the artificial, and said, "Thus I hold the mirror up to
Nature!" Musically, the piece (as it has always
seemed to us) rather suffers by this. The ideas are
more than usually re-repeated; and, remarkably, reiterations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
(though perhaps there was a psychological
reason for this in the soul of Beethoven, as instinctively
expressive, over and over again, of the one
great joy he felt, or as saying&mdash;"After all, the essence
and compelling spirit of this great Nature is one").
Moreover, the ideas, though in themselves beautifully
pure and characteristic, seem almost <i>too</i> simple, nay
we had almost said languid, for they rather suggest
to us the gratification of a convalescent than of a
passionately profound (aye, and profoundly passionate)
lover of nature, such as all Germans are, such as
Schumann intensely was, and such as Beethoven must
have exceptionally been. (Brendel says, Haydn's
love of nature, as revealed in his music, was that of
her very child, unconscious; Beethoven's, that of a
town-dweller, conscious. But to this I would reply,
town-dweller by compulsion). On the other hand, if
Beethoven wished to enter a protest against <i>Schwärmerei</i>,
for nature, none could be more effective than
this movement. But nature ever was and remains
mystic, and no celebration of her, above all by a
Beethoven, can satisfy us which does not shadow
forth, is not overpowered by, a sense of this&mdash;sense
peculiar to this latter age; more so, even, than the
similar companion-sense of love. Love without
<i>Schwärmerei</i> were not love; no more is love of
nature. For these profounder realizations of nature,
"glances into the deepest deeps of beauty," (Carlyle,
on the remark about "the lilies of the field") reflected
adumbrations of her wizardry, a sense of her
intoxicating aroma, the ecstasy in her bosom, that
mesmerizing infinitude of hers, we must look to Beethoven's
sonatas, or other portions of his symphonies;
and to such music as Schumann's; hardly in his Pastoral
Symphony (except somewhat in the andante);
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
more in his Pastoral Sonata&mdash;<i>that</i> first movement is
<i>profound</i>, as well as richer. There we see the poet-philosopher,
nay, high-priest of nature; and the
movement, four-square, almost perfect, is one of the
masterpieces, and most precious legacies of Nature's
Eldest Child. In the present movement we have
peaceful pleasure, but not rapture, if even joy, or
delight (in the Sonata Pastorale we have contemplative
joy)&mdash;though Beethoven may possibly have
expressly chastened the expression of feeling, as being,
so, more "pastoral." Be that as it may, here we
have sweetness rather than power (except, indeed,
behind all); nay, rather the gratification of an habitual
dweller in the country (and he no longer a
young man), than the burst of rapture we might have
expected from a lover of nature only just let loose from
town. However, Beethoven <i>has</i> written over the movements&mdash;"<i>Awakening</i>
of cheerful emotions on arrival
in the country." He further said, the symphony was
feeling rather than painting. This is a matter of
course from a Beethoven; and note, it is a Beethoven's
feelings that are depicted. What we have in
the work is Nature <i>plus</i> Beethoven&mdash;nature photographed
after passing through him, and so becoming
idealised. We have, however, both scene-painting
and soul-painting through the emotions here excited
and described; we see also the landscape which to
a great extent occasioned them; (thus, this, like
Goethe's, is an occasional poem). It is a truly pastoral
district; quiet, sunny scenery, with a scent of
the earliest hay; but nature in her splendour, with,
say, in the distance, the great sea; nature, a blaze of
flowers embosomed in hills, as in our own beautiful
England in May; let alone nature in spring, with her
background of Alps and Appenines. Nature, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
greatest hint&mdash;the secret of whose greatest power is,
Immortality; a promise of that is hardly here celebrated;
or, rather, that hint is not, for it is in every
landscape:&mdash;"I, too, have looked upon the hills in
their hazy veil, but their greatest charm, to me, was
their promise." Neither, in spite of Elterlein's
charming allusion, have we the scenery where, or the
time when (<i>soust</i>) as Goethe so truly, sublimely expresses
it (in two of his most inspired lines)&mdash;</p>

<p>(exquisite image of immortality bearing along mortality)&mdash;is
richer in significance. There, indeed, we
do get some of those deep glimpses, far glances (and
tender ones into flower-cups)&mdash;those unspeakable hints
(note especially, as usual, the passage in the extra-poetic
key of G flat; where, however, also as usual,
Beethoven lingers too little; indeed, even he seems
rather to <i>deviate</i> into such keys, and to be afraid of
dwelling in them). We see Beethoven, the colossally
<i>un</i>happy soul, here at least happy, nay, blessed;
lapped in flowers; caressed by the stream; soothed
and tended by all the "angels and ministers of grace"
of nature; while the everlasting heaven pronounces
its benediction over him.</p>

<p>For our own part, we are specially affected, because
we call to mind a brook where we also were
wont to be happy. But, it was not in quiet scenery,
but in a Swiss mountain-valley; the brook came from
heaven, and coursed through pine-woods and pastures
into a stupendously beautiful lake, the shadows of
whose mighty guardian Alps are reflected also in the
Moonlight Sonata; while, afar off, as it were in colossal
admonition, towered those eternal reminders,
the peaks of the Bernese Oberland.</p>

<p>The Scherzo has always seemed to us an inspiration&mdash;as
much as the storm; so original and powerful,
so tuneful in its picturesque, spontaneous gaiety.
It is Beethoven at his genialist. The sublimity of
the storm may speak for itself: I will only remark, in
reply to the German Hume, who rather cavils and
carps, and is no Beethoven-worshipper (but Mozart),
and says "the cause for such a very loud storm is too
trifling"&mdash;that the storm <i>also</i> perchance broke over
crowned heads and the fate of empires (Napoleon
died in a storm, and so, just as curiously characteristic,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
did Beethoven). Storms do, too, come up
in the brightest summer day (without or within us);
and, in short, though the criticism is truly philosophical,
that it should be left doubtful whether the
storm was a physical or moral one&mdash;of nature or
human nature&mdash;Beethoven, as ever, is entitled to a
genial interpretation, a liberal application. In the
meanwhile, <i>as</i> a storm&mdash;storm of music, as well as
musical storm&mdash;it is as grand as original; shaking us
with the fullness of those sublime emotions of the
natural storm (and surely our German Hume would
not disparage these!), and its introduction is a happy
felicity.</p>

<p><i>Beethoven's</i> "Lobgesang," which concludes the
work, is very noble in its unstudied beauty, expressing
"pious and grateful feelings" by unsophisticated
men after storm. The treatment of the greatly-simple
theme is a masterpiece and model. Here is
Wagner anticipated, but not spoilt! To sum up:
the first movement, very exceptionally, is the weakest
of all; and the whole work, though a treasure of its
own, coming from Beethoven, revealing him as singularly
loveable, is in no way so surpassing as to
preclude the attempt by a follower also to compose
a Pastoral Symphony. We conclude with Herr
Elterlein's summary of the work&mdash;very charming,
although he finds in the allegro considerably more
than we do.</p>

<p>"A refreshing morning breeze greets us; we
have left behind the crowds and walls of the town.
We are in the mood of Faust, on the sunny Easter
spring morning. At first we are in silent rapture, the
climax is not yet reached, Nature's myriad living
voices do not at once re-echo in our inmost spirit.
The farther we wander, the more natural beauties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
open up and greet us, the more multifarious becomes
the scene. In proportion as the variety becomes
richer, and the impression of this divine beauty&mdash;(<i>Gottesnatur</i>&mdash;German
ought to be <i>known by every
musician</i>, and read in the original, because their
pregnant, often pantheistic, shades of expression,
become lost in English; or, if 'transcribed,' are 'not
English')&mdash;deeper, the more our rapture swells to
utmost joy. Now, we perfectly revel (<i>schwelgen ganz</i>)
in the full feast; entirely abandon ourselves to the
impressions of absolute Nature; completely at one
with ourselves, in this kingdom, we feel ourselves at
one with her.</p>

<p>"We have now reached the acmé of enthusiasm;
our soul trembles in silent ecstasy; involuntarily the
desire awakes in us, after expatiating in the universal
beauty of Nature, to contemplate and enjoy her still
life and operations in intimate communion.</p>

<p>"Therefore, the scene changes in the second movement.
We are transplanted to a peaceful woodland
vale, through which a brook babbles. <i>'Scene am
Bach</i>,' the tone-picture is also called by the master;
it is elaborated out in the most thoughtful manner,
and displays before us, in the richest, fullest colours,
the murmur of the brook, the rustling of the swayed
tree-tops, and the song of the birds. At last the
brook is still, the trees rustle no more; we have
already once said farewell to the soft babbling that
long kept us spell-bound&mdash;quail, cuckoo, and nightingale
are alone still heard.&mdash;(Beautifully imagined!)
as it were, also saying 'farewell' to the sympathetic
wanderer up the vale; who, only another human
form of them, had stayed so long with them, loving
them like their brother, enchanted by their song&mdash;enchanted
in Nature's bosom. This way of putting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
it (of receiving it) is only another proof of the non-materialism,
non-superficialism, nay, of the beauty of
this passage (withal, quite brief&mdash;<i>only introduced at the
end</i>); and a proof of the value and necessity of sympathetic
audition of a Beethoven's works. (Only a
poet&mdash;never Dryasdust&mdash;can rightly criticise a poet).</p>

<p>"In the third movement the scene is again
changed. We find ourselves in meadows. The characteristic
multiformity of this piece would have told
us its meaning, without the master's words. So, too,
the storm&mdash;those tones full of fearful, dark sublimity.
At last, the tempest and its fury cease, only in the
distance the thunder still growls; the blue sky again
opens up, the evening sun casts its mild light o'er the
landscape&mdash;(genial thought)&mdash;enlivened by shepherds
whose shalm now sounds.</p>

<p>"The fourth movement, therefore, is dedicated to
'Shepherd's Song,'&mdash;'pious and grateful feelings after
the storm.' The grateful strains begin softly, then
swell ever more and more to topmost joy, pouring
forth at their climax an intense, solemn, and yet
again such a plain, simple thank-offering to Nature's
Creator."</p>

<h3><a name="Symphony_No_7_Op_92" id="Symphony_No_7_Op_92">
<span class="smcap">Symphony, No. 7, Op. 92.</span></a></h3>


<p>In this magnificent symphony, the most picturesque
of all, Beethoven seemed to have taken a new lease of
originality. It is specially instructive and encouraging
on that account; and, amongst other evidences, makes
us weigh, whether his "third manner" (whereof this
may be considered the noble isthmus that joins those
continents), was really progress or decay, or a dubious
transition step to something higher. However, the
work is reckoned among those of his second manner,
and so is certainly a potent argument for those who,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
with enlightened honesty (and not Philistine blindness),
feel that Beethoven's second style is, <i>par excellence</i>,
Beethoven&mdash;whether Wagner began or not
where Beethoven left off. <i>Apropos</i> of Wagner, does
not this "Poco Sostenuto" call to mind that Wizard
of the South's famous morçeaux in "Lohengrin," in
the same key? Is not the style&mdash;nay, the motiv&mdash;much
the same?&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">
   <img src="images/p_087.jpg" width="500" height="86" alt="Music Score" /><br />
   <a href="music_files/p-087.mid">[Listen]</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There seems something of the same <i>mysticism</i>, though
Beethoven is not tainted with the morbidness one
scents in Wagner; seems, as a whole, broader, nobler,
more <i>natural</i>, more truly deep; in a word, more
healthy, and therefore greater, notwithstanding Wagner's
undoubted genius, and still more stupendous
energy for which we most envy him. This opening
theme has a powerful tranquility about it&mdash;like that,
say, of some Epaminondas; seems, as it were, an
assurance and announcement that Beneficence, at
bottom and after all, is paramount in this stupendous
paradox and discrepancy called the universe; notwithstanding,
it seems to go on to say, the ground-bass
of storm, on and over which true heroism will ever
ride (<i>re-entry of the theme ff</i>); notwithstanding the
painfulnesses, which are only subtler proofs and
manifestations of self-justified righteousness and
power&mdash;most sublime in its subtlest judgments&mdash;as
the private life of every self-strict person knows.
Then, a new theme&mdash;fragment of the same essential
peace&mdash;enters; curiously (and beautifully) reminding
us of that early, early work of Beethoven's (Oh,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Rhine-lad, written <i>how</i> long ago!), the Sonata in C
dedicated to Haydn&mdash;</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>but gaining by being slow.</p>

<p>But "action, action, action," which these climbing
basses&mdash;("And ever climbing up the climbing wave"),
"life is painfully real,"&mdash;seem to say, soon break in
again on this Elysian dream. It re-appears, however,
like a heavenly messenger, holding us spellbound,
in a trance or veritable dream, whereof these
two conflicting elements form the chief apparitions;
conflicting, yet viewed largely, harmonious, like their
counterparts in that oneness, Life,&mdash;whose painfulnesses
are as much a <i>necessary</i> part of it, as discords
are of entire music.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><a name="The_Vivace" id="The_Vivace">
<span class="smcap">The Vivace.</span></a></h4>

<p>Great pictures&mdash;pictures of great action (like the
actions themselves)&mdash;represent the moral qualities
behind. Hence, many a page of music, eminently of
Beethoven, may be objectively or subjectively interpreted,
or both. It is the usual practice, and a
natural one, to regard the "Eroica" symphony as
objective, and the C minor as subjective&mdash;both illustrating
the grand abstract fact, Conflict. The <i>vivace</i>
of the A major symphony <i>strikes</i>, no less, as objective.
There is a ringing cheerfulness about it that suggests
no spiritual struggles, psychological battle, but the
open air and its beloved objects&mdash;by no means
excluding the world's great foreground feature, man;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
rather, pre-eminently presenting and illustrating him,
and this from your Beethoven, the intensely subjective
soul. Intensely subjective, yes! far more
so,&mdash;more grandly so,&mdash;than your Byron; more
<i>characteristically</i> so than Shakespeare; but, nevertheless&mdash;nay,
therefore&mdash;also more truly, nobly objective
than the former, kin with the latter (Turner is
greater than Rosa).</p>

<p>It is impossible to overstate the bright, the exhilarating
impression of these tones. Here we at once
revel in the outer world, in all the</p>

<p class="center">April of its prime,</p>

<p>and feel ourselves magically strung up to virile deeds,
to face the "rugged Hyrcanian boar"&mdash;"to do or
die." Here the ringing woodland of feudal times is
around us, and all the panoply, pride, pomp, and
circumstance of a royal chase. The motto of Stephen
Heller's admirable "Chasse" was very apt, which
records how the French monarch, plunged in gloom by
the death of his beloved, seeks distraction in the chase.
Sir Walter&mdash;of our erst beloved "Ivanhoe"&mdash;comes
sweeping through the mind; a rush of joy almost to
tears. We see Garth, born thrall of Cedric, and the
Jester in the gladed woodland; and there, at the
glittering jousts (even more so) the heavenly Rebecca,
Rowena, the Hero, and the Knight Templar; Jew
and Christian; plumèd knight and lovely dame. This
music is Ivanhoe, not forgetting the glamour of the
Crusades, with knight and Saracen, and the breath of
the Holy Land through it. Here is the chivalry of
warriors, who fought for the Cross; in an age&mdash;so different
from ours&mdash;when there was a frenzy of belief (thus
we be-soul our objective); here is a phalanx of Bayards
<i>sans peur et sans reproche</i>, inflamed with passion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
hatred and love, <i>en route</i> to storm their way to
Calvary. This is the picture to fill our mind with;
though we may also think of this glorious music as
painting forth the Conqueror William, breaking up
the chase to invade Harold's England, as being rock'd
over thither on crisp seas in knight-throng'd vessels,
gallant with streaming pennon; though we may also
think of Ferdinand going out to welcome Columbus
(in our copy, at the passage in G minor we
have ejaculated, "Our Columbus"&mdash;Beethoven!&mdash;"has
found a New World"), of Cortes and
Pizarro invading Mexico (copper-coloured men and
tropical scenery we may also conjure up); or, again,
of Philip and his pompous Armada&mdash;of Elizabeth and
English chivalry preparing to greet him. But that
picture of the Crusades best suits us. So our nothing-if-not-religious
Beethoven, the glorious genius, in
the name of music, whose High Priest he was
(and whom other great spirits serve), concerned only
to pour forth what streamed into him; or rather,
concerned only to let it stream through him (for
it is certain he did not intentionally celebrate and
pourtray all that his mighty music suggests, however
the Germans may stamp it as Intellectual Music, <i>die
Musik des Geistes</i>), so our hardly-entreated, much-bound,
but triumphant immortal shadowed forth, on
canvas made of air, pictures surpassing Angelo and
Raphael&mdash;pictures that only a painter-Shakespeare
could surpass or rival&mdash;pictures that have the material
splendour and <i>éclat</i> of a Rubens, the intense originality
of a Rembrandt, <i>plus</i> a <i>soul</i> behind and within them,
which only higher spirits than they can glimmeringly
reveal. We have but to repeat, that these
tone-pictures have always a charm <i>plus</i> (or even
apart from), viz., that of the tones themselves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Our interpretation of this master-movement is the
same as that of Marx Nohl and Elterlein (whom we
should <i>like</i> to quote at length). Wagner's idea,
genially understood, is also acceptable. That gifted
despot "finds in the Symphony the apotheosis of the
Dance <i>der in Tönen idealisch verkörperten Leibesbewegung</i>."
Yes, it is a dance that sings; high dance
and song together, as at some Pindar-celebrated
Festival of Apollo; nay, of some ideal, some
skylark soul of joy, not so much convinced of, as absolute
lyrical part of, and one with the All; and
threatening to melt for very rapture in its bosom.
The Dance!&mdash;that is applicable enough, too! What a
majestic <i>pas de deux</i> is this ever advancing and retiring
Day and Night! What a stately minuet the
Four Seasons! The river dances to the sea; the
blood (of the lover-poet) dances in the veins; what
a wild waltz of elements we have!&mdash;galop of the north
wind; the very sea as it were dances in prolonged
rhythmic sway, "<i>molto maestoso</i>," to the all-compelling
moon; nay, the moon and stars themselves,
with stupendous majesty "keep time" to their
"music of the spheres" through space; and the
great rhythm of obedience&mdash;action and re-action,
attraction and repulsion&mdash;is the grand universal law.</p>

<p>Such are some of the lessons and suggestions of
this curiously happy, magnificently pregnant rhythmic
movement of Beethoven's; his first great performance
in his new lease of originality&mdash;great step on
the new road to immortality. The motive itself,
truly a motive, is as exquisitely tuneful and simple
(how great was Beethoven in not straining after
effect!) as <i>grossartig</i>; and, <i>en passant</i>, it has
only to be compared for our instruction for one
moment with Mendelssohn's "Song without words."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
"The Chase," in the same key and time, Book I,
to show the <i>striking</i> superiority of Beethoven; nay,
their generic difference&mdash;Mendelssohn was talent, and
Beethoven genius. The grandiose breadth, the unstudied
inspiration (cause of the former) is essentially,
fatally absent in Mendelssohn, say what his fascinated
devotees may! It is with him almost all talent and
fancy, not oracle and prophecy. He is only a nephew
of Beethoven's, Schumann his "well-beloved" son (as
Wagner is of Schumann).</p>

<p>I should be wrong not to give some of Herr
Elterlein's ideas. After citing Wagner's notion, and
repudiating it (naturally enough, unless one gives due
weight to the word apotheosis, and due interpretation
to the word dance), he alludes to (and also rejects as
premature) the notion of Alberti, and others, that the
symphony is an "announcement of German triumph
and enthusiasm at their freedom at length from the
French yoke." He then says, "Marx and Nohl
seem to us to come nearer the truth, when the
former finds embodied in the symphony the life of a
southern people, especially of the Moorish race in
ancient Spain,"&mdash;(picturesquely suggestive this; only
does not the key-colouring seem rather too cool?
have we not Teutonic brilliance rather than Oriental?)&mdash;"and
the latter" (Herr Dr. Nohl), "<i>ritterliche Festpracht</i>"
in general (the festival splendour of chivalry).
He continues:&mdash;"We also, the more and more profoundly
we have entered into this creation, have become
clearer convinced, that, as in the "Eroica," we
have displayed political heroism, battling and victorious;
in the C minor symphony, the moral conflicts
and triumphs of man; so in the A major symphony,
we behold the manifold life and phenomena (<i>Lebensströmungen</i>)
of a chivalrous, imaginative, hot-blooded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
people, in the full enjoyment of their health and
power. We fancy one might prefix Goethe's words&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Im</i> vollgewühl, im lebensregen Drange<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vermischte sich die thätige Völkerschaar."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">("In lusty swarms, crowds full of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deedful peoples intermixed.")<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"To arms! is now the word&mdash;arms and harness; and
forwards to the peaceful jousts in the fair land. And
now, how all hearts at first lightly thrill! then pulses
beat ever higher; the crowds muster; the warrior
horsemen curvet and gambol on slender steeds; pennons
glitter, armour dazzles, swords flash in the
sun; and the motley swarms stream forth pell-mell,
not to bloody battle, like the hero-spirits of the
"Eroica,"&mdash;no, but the peaceful tournament!"</p>

<p>The scherzo and finale ("a sort of Bacchus triumph"&mdash;?)
we shall abstain from discussing (they are of
much less intrinsic import than the first two movements);
but conclude with a glance at the greatest
movement of all (with creditable and instinctive
instinct almost always redemanded) the allegretto;
first, however, citing two remarkable passages from
the finale, worthy the attention of those correspondents
of the <i>Musical Standard</i> on "False Notation,"
especially of that one "whose memory could
not serve him whether such a passage occurred in the
masters":&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>This repeatedly and persistently occurs; and it
would have been gratifying had Beethoven indicated
what he meant by it:&mdash;"Bacchusfest?"&mdash;or something
deeper? The other passage is curiously like
the one ventured by Dr. Macfarren's criticiser. The
venture was no doubt perfectly justifiable&mdash;almost
everything is allowable in music, for deliberate poetic
effect.</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beethoven no doubt did it for the sake of intensity.</p>

<p>[P.S.&mdash;Since writing the above we have come across
a chance remark of Goethe's, which struck us as singularly
applicable to this great picturesque symphony.
During the campaign in France, he noticed in one
of the old German towns, the living contrast of
knighthood and monkhood (or chivalry and the
cloister, we might say). The suggestive words set us
thinking if they might not prompt a symphony; and
soon after, we saw that they may be applied, perhaps
with curious felicity, to Beethoven's A major. Have
we not here, indeed, an epitome of the olden time,
with its knights, monks, revels, and all?]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><a name="The_Allegretto" id="The_Allegretto">
<span class="smcap">The Allegretto.</span></a></h4>

<p>This has been well called "the riddle" of the symphony;
nor can we altogether accept Herr Elterlein's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
solution of it, though <i>geistreich</i>. He prolongs
his fancy, and looks upon this music as a contagious
pause and period of melancholy, of pathetic reminiscence
in the "hot-blooded southern folk." Imaginative
sympathy has a right to its own fancies, and
these fancies will ever be more or less true; nevertheless,
a more profound, more sacred gloom&mdash;mystery
of sorrow&mdash;is borne in upon us in these unfathomable
tones. Here we seem to have the portentous, almost
God-accusing, grief of insane love and virtue, in this
fate-and-madness-haunted world&mdash;of Juliet in the tomb
(re-read the tremendous lines)&mdash;of the ineffable Ophelia,
after outraged princeliness and intellect had lost its
reason, and killed Ophelia's own venerable father;&mdash;"Ach!"
previous to the violent death (her own) of
an angel. Or, we might feel here the incipient
atheism of a Hamlet himself; wrestling with it, but
dreading he wrestles in vain. Later, it is true (the
A major melody&mdash;"immortal" Berlioz calls it), solace
descends from heaven, through the toppling sun-gilt
clouds; but it is unavailing (indeed, we rather regret
the introduction of this episode? we had liefer be
plunged to, and remain in, the heart of this "deeper,
and deeper still" of grief): Rachel will not be
comforted, in her <i>sublime</i> despair; and the final
strains seem those of incurable, illimitable woe. Ah!
these are the strains, too, the accents&mdash;"Oh, Jerusalem,
Jerusalem! thou that killest the prophets, how
often would I have gathered thee as a hen gathereth
her chickens and thou wouldst not!" The divine
resolution to sacrifice self for all that (the A major
motive?) remains even firmer, but the divine sorrow
<i>at</i> it remains even deeper and inextinguishable.

<span class="smcap">Symphony No. 8. Op. 93.</span></a></h3>

<p>Man divides his time chiefly between love (of all
sorts) and action. One of his most passionate, as
well as purest, loves, is of nature. When the two
blend&mdash;when at once the lover, and lover of nature,
roams in nature, besouling and transfiguring her by
love, then is passion at its sweetest, life at its highest.
In this opening gush, or burst, of the 8th Symphony
(<i>allegro vivace e con brio</i>) we seem to have such love.
Here is that rapture we missed in the expressly culled
Pastoral Symphony&mdash;rapture of emancipation, thrill
and burst of joy! The great action of the Eroica,
and C minor&mdash;aye, and of the A major symphonies&mdash;here
gives place to the pure ecstatic emotion.</p>

<p>Here we have indeed the broad breath of the fields;
we perfectly revel in the flowery gold; the sweet
streams winding there enchant us; the blue mountains
sublime us with their great tender reminders;
in the divine whole&mdash;this "<i>transcenden Tempel des
Frühlings</i>"&mdash;we are ready to fall on our knees for
joy. Rural, without doubt, are these opening strains;
"escaped into the country"&mdash;"love in the country,"
seems written over them. Later, Alberti's and Elterlein's
notion (independent) more obtains; "the
symphony represents humour," (chiefly caprice, mood);
"the base and character of the work is throughout
humouristic." This, however, may well be, and the
scene of these caprices still remains the divine country;
the lights and shadows and fleecy clouds of the soul
amid those of nature. Here we may fancy the scene
of a superior Watteau. By running brook and swaying
bough, gracious nymph and gallant swain exchange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
fancies and glances, and sport, and make love. Nay
it is indeed like a back-glance of our Beethoven himself
into his early years&mdash;when the days were bluer,
the world broader, by the celestial Rhine yonder, and
when he too, in his sweet and awful heart, felt
shy unutterable emotions; thrill'd, as though fire
had flashed in waves through his veins when <i>she</i>
touched his hand&mdash;that hand to be so creative. This
may be a glance at those days, as the Countess Guicciardini
Sonata (most lyric of all, like the passion of
an Oriental night) is a burning record of others.</p>

<p>In a word, and finally, Beethoven, who was essentially
imaginative, has in this pendent to the Fourth
Symphony, given himself up to, and given us, fancy;
and a gracious present it is, like a handful of pearls,
from the master. Not less precious, but more precious,
are the smiles and sportive caresses of Hercules&mdash;the
pleasantries of Jove. Ah! He who challenged
the terrors of the cross, and threatened <i>Dies Irae</i>,
(we must ever recur to Him as our highest type),
spoke of the lilies of the field, and gathered to him
little children; and more precious, if possible, than
his words, or very deeds, were&mdash;if He ever had them&mdash;his
smiles.</p>

<p>The query is suggested by this youth-fresh work&mdash;did
Beethoven write this Opus 93 out of his heart
at that age (if so, what a heart!&mdash;with styles one and
three close together), or did he draw upon fancies of
his early years&mdash;tone-lyrics of that time?</p>

<p>The Allegretto Scherzando, that Ariel-gush ("On a
bat's back I do fly") is thus described by the German
critic:&mdash;"In the second movement we have,
especially, naïve joy; nay, at once the child-like
innocence and mischievous sport of humour. The
first motiv (as is well known) had its origin in a playful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
canon improvised by Beethoven for the metronome-maker,
Maelzel; the whole piece has been
praised by many, as the most charming morçeaux of
Beethoven's." The Minuet he speaks of as dry
humour, the Trio as revealing an inner <i>Liebesdrange</i>
(urgent need of and for love)&mdash;"such as is ever innate
in the true humourist."</p>

<p>The Finale seems another piece of "Tempest"
music; now grateful as chased or filagree silver, now
inly tender, as the soul of Ferdinand and Miranda of
course is; now, even with a glance at the "dæmonish."
These extraordinary "<i>Schreckennoten</i>," now as C sharp,
now as D flat&mdash;which we were tempted to substitute on
the first appearance of the note as C sharp&mdash;may furnish
another pretty quarrel between the wranglers over
"False Notation." They form one of the most original
flashes of Beethoven (if not a hint of aberration),
and strike us as properly belonging to a profoundly
tragic movement, and not to such a one as this;
where, indeed, their value seems hardly utilised.
Such notes might have been blown as the "Blast
of the breath of His displeasure"&mdash;before the Hand-writing
on the Wall; at the Rending of the Veil 'fore
the Holy of Holies; at the dawn of the Day of
Doom; though, indeed, this latter also would break
upon fairy revels, foambells, and butterflies, as well as
wars, earthquakes, and volcanoes.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we regret the absence of an Adagio
in this genial work. We now turn to the portentous
Choral Symphony.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="The_Choral_Symphony_Op_125" id="The_Choral_Symphony_Op_125">
<span class="smcap">The Choral Symphony, Op. 125.</span></a></h3>


<p>A noble poet, on reading certain strophes in a long
poem to a friend, remarked that they were experiments.
The remark rather jarred, at the time, on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
friend's ear, and sunk into his mind. <i>Apropos</i>, say
what one will about the Choral Symphony, it strikes
us as an experiment. The very title seems empiric.
What we should understand by a choral symphony
would be a symphonically grand chorus blended with
a symphony; but this is rather a chorus preceded by
a symphony&mdash;its opposite, too (though intentionally),
in character; in part independent of, in part made
up of the themes of the chorus. Now, a similar
work&mdash;Mendelssohn's "Lobgesang,"&mdash;struck us as
being likewise an experiment, and not a happy
one; the prevailing and overpowering impression
was&mdash;"Oh! when will the singers begin?"
This gigantic preluding of the essential is a distracting
postponement, a colossal interruption&mdash;difficult to
be done justice to by the impatient hearer, even if
perfect in itself. But, if perfect <i>in</i> itself, it would be
more perfect <i>by</i> itself&mdash;(?)&mdash;for, as a prelude, it remains
subordinate; and this to the symphony is
fatally derogatory. Most "experiments" are mistakes
in judgment, and these in art. This symphony
strikes us as disproportionate as well as incongruous&mdash;no
less serious musical than statuesque and architectural
faults. We feel that it is indeed bound up
with, but not one of the others; that it is an appendix.
Beethoven himself began, after it, another
symphony, whole in itself, like the others. No doubt
he was impressed (and rightly) with the feeling that
an Ode to Joy demanded a grandiose introduction;
but he made an elementary mistake (?) in making
that introduction too long and heterogeneous&mdash;in
short, by giving us a symphony instead of an overture.
With respect to its character, let us draw a
little nearer&mdash;it is, no doubt, of the greatest importance.
In this symphony, Beethoven summoned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
up all his then powers to pour forth and portray
in one tremendous focus <i>the</i> conflict which his
symphonies and deeper music more or less generally
depict, viz., that of Pessimism and Optimism&mdash;of
good and evil. And in this he was herald-representative
of the nineteenth century. Bach,
Handel, Haydn, and Mozart, did not depict this
struggle; at least we are not <i>struck</i> by it. Pathos,
and even tragedy, in general they too of course
reveal&mdash;for joy and sadness make up music; nay,
sadness is perhaps the soul of music, at least Beethoven
makes us think so; but the characteristic
Hamletism of the nineteenth century (which is Hamlet&mdash;as,
according to Freiligrath, Germany is, or was
before 1870),&mdash;it was reserved for Beethoven to manifest
forth; Beethoven, the greatest Hamlet (not Faust
he was too good) of all. The other centuries were
centuries of belief or unbelief; this is one of doubt,
with a soul&mdash;belief, groping after a new one. It <i>will</i>
be new, and not local&mdash;let alone parochial. Fearful
doubts must have seized thinking, feeling men, at all
times, after looking abroad and pondering what we
have called this tremendous paradox and discrepancy,
the universe. St. Paul himself said, with poignant
realization, "The world groaneth and travaileth until
'now';" and it is difficult to overstate the wide-spread
and individual imperfection and unhappiness. This
sense, of old, drove men into what we called a frenzy
of belief&mdash;in something exterior. That they clutched,
and to that they clung, nailing their gaze, as it were,
to happiness promised for faith bestowed; and full of
such a fearful sense of the wretchedness below, that
they laughed to scorn even torture and the stake;
and warped away from this world, to bide wholly in
the contemplation of another. As might have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
predicted, however, this, too, could only be a phase
and period of transition (and that not a long one in
the history of man; we must revolutionise our ideas
of time and greatness); and, inevitably, when science,
beginning greatly with Copernicus, set in, Luther,
the first Freethinker (modern), would soon follow,
and in due course a Hume, a Spinoza, a Schopenhauer,
and a Kant. Our Beethoven, who had his
own "categorical inspiration," no doubt derived terrible
arguments for Pessimism from few things more
emphatic than his own life&mdash;so mysteriously gifted
and afflicted, stinted and endowed. Hence, then,
the Titanic character of his music; the tremendous
temptation in the wilderness (of his own heart, of a
feared to be God abandoned world), of a soul inclining
to good, to go over to evil&mdash;but the good in the
end is triumphant, and we see it ever struggling
through:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In pits of passion and dens of woe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We see strong Eros struggling through.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At the end of the awful conflict shadowed forth in
the colossal opening of the choral symphony, we have
been tempted to inscribe, "as if the world's heart-strings
were cracking":&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">
   <img src="images/p_101.jpg" width="400" height="258" alt="Music Score" /><br />
   <a href="music_files/p-101.mid">[Listen]</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;the atheism of a King David himself: "the fool
hath said in his heart, there is no God!" but after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
that (the recitative to "O'er the raging waters of
Galilee, the voice of One 'who made the storm his
mere mantle, and the sea the pathway of power'":)
the voice of peace&mdash;in modern dialect the voice of
man; in the light of which reading, this entry of the
human voice becomes portentous, as though it said,
let the elements rage, let the arts stutter, the human
voice alone can bring relief&mdash;light, and hope, and
joy.</p>

<p>Thus, Beethoven's design was characteristically and
colossally grand; he wished to strive to paint what
painting certainly could not, and what sculpture
could not&mdash;nay, in a sense, what poetry could not,
for words cannot represent a conflict (especially of
the emotions) like music, cannot so awfully or
sweetly thrill the soul. And he succeeded in a way
that Michael Angelo (his analogue) and Raphael
(whom Beethoven also blended with the Angelo in
him), certainly did not, when they foolishly attempted
to paint the unpaintable (the Last Judgment, and
Transfiguration). Whether, however, he succeeded
musically, in this symphony, as a tail-work, is a debateable
question. The query may be put&mdash;Might
he not have treated the Pessimism also vocally, and
thereby avoided the undue length and unsupported
character of the instrumental prelude? The work
would then have been a homogenous whole. But,
and perhaps even more importantly, the question
arises&mdash;Might not the music itself have been better?
The second movement, <i>Molto vivace</i>, marvellously
pourtrays (before Wagner) the <i>Venusberg</i>&mdash;the Mephistopheles-pact
into which the poor despairing
Pessimist may be driven to plunge; and we recollect
well how we felt after first hearing the <i>Adagio
molto e cantabile</i>, and going away perforce into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
outside world; <i>Ach! that</i> is the true world&mdash;that
world we have been in; and this is a world of dross!
But the first movement we cannot help feeling to be
laboured, especially in parts, compared with that of the
C minor, which is simply one rush of inspiration, and
the chief theme of the last movement is, we must say
it, tame and undignified, if not commonplace&mdash;nay,
almost "jiggy," played and sung so fast (<i>allegro assai</i>)&mdash;not
to compare for one moment with that other
burst, the Hallelujah Chorus, (or "For unto us"),
or many of Beethoven's own motivs. But, besides,
it is guilty of the gross, the heinous offence
in this instance, of setting words utterly different.
Here is the melody; notice, besides its extremely
smooth (amounting, as we say, to the commonplace)
character (and so, not characteristic)&mdash;notice, that
it consists (<i>mirabile dictu!</i>) merely of one strain
repeated, with the cadence slightly altered (full,
instead of half):&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>and then the phrase to the words "With thy fire

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"All men are Brothers, where, sweet Joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy gentle wing is furl'd."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But, much worse&mdash;nay, absolutely shocking to the
spiritual sense, is the persistent use of the same
phrase, mediocre as it is, to these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who that victory hath gained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a friend, the friend to be;<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Would it have been thought possible for Beethoven
(Inspired Instinct), to set these last lines to the same&mdash;we
are almost provoked to say, rattling jingle. To
a lower deep, alas! our Beethoven-Hamlet could
scarcely fall&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"Oh, what a sovereign mind is there o'erthrown!"</p>

<p>It was an incredible aboriginal mistake to set these
lines to the same time, let alone same tune. Nor,
indeed, can his choice of the words be considered
happy. What made him in his grand old age (old
for him) so harp upon Schiller's crude performance,
we know not; nay, we ask whether a Beethoven
should not have treated the glorious subject, Joy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
when he was already young;&mdash;despise as he might
(an egregious error) his earlier works. Had he at
least undertaken it when he wrote the Symphony in
D and the "Eroica"; or, in the "high and palmy
state" of his powers, when he wrote the <i>facile princeps</i>
C minor! Schiller's first words would alone repel us;
he talks&mdash;"babbles" would be the strictly truer word,
barbarously babbles&mdash;of joy, as that spark of the
gods, and, in the same breath, daughter out of Elysium.
How could he so talk of that grand abstract fact&mdash;Joy!
Joy, the sunshine of the soul&mdash;whose glow, thence
outwards, fills the Universe; life, absolute being;
wherein alone we rightly, fully live. We have no
patience with such barbarous metaphorising, such
schoolboy personification, such hectic rapture! No
wonder Beethoven failed, falling on such words as
these.</p>

<p>(In passing&mdash;he has a few bars of interlude which
Mendelssohn's famous "'Tis thus decreed," strangely
resembles.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">
   <img src="images/p_105.jpg" width="400" height="108" alt="Music Score" /><br />
   <a href="music_files/p-105.mid">[Listen]</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the C were sharp, the passages would be identical.</p>

<p>In continuation&mdash;Beethoven seems in general
equally careless (or perverse) and unhappy in his
treatment of the words&mdash;a curious misfortune in an
expressly vocal celebration. We have the same
smooth passages, and the same rattling pace, for
various inflections of thought and feeling. He does
not fail, however, to give us one of those "flashes" of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
his true genius, old power, which Spohr alluded to,
at the words <i>ver Gott</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">
   <img src="images/p_106.jpg" width="200" height="127" alt="Music Score" /><br />
   <a href="music_files/p-106.mid">[Listen]</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He proceeds thenceforth to intermix symphony
with words in the way we spoke of as that which
would seem natural to a choral symphony; and of
the passage where the great broad theme (far happier)
is <i>blended</i> below, with the original motiv. Dr. Nohl
strikingly remarks, that "Lo! here was a proof that
music is also a thinker!" No doubt in our glorious
Beethoven, who was all heart, and soul, and brain,
(<i>plus</i> robust body, till his sad latter days), if not
exactly <i>mens sana in corpore sano</i>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, on the whole, we feel we must agree
with Spohr (surely no unworthy judge, unless blinded
by envy); and still rank this symphony as a colossal
experiment rather than a genial success. As far as
our feelings are a guide (and we have expressly
acknowledged at the outset, how each one of us is
the creature of prejudice and mood), we find the
work veritably stamped and distinguished by laboured
elaboration&mdash;nay, almost painful labour. Beethoven
(we feel) perpetuated a fundamental, primary, pregnant
mistake, in <i>setting himself</i> to "work out" one
melodic idea, and that such a poor one&mdash;disappointing
almost to exasperation. Above all, varied words
cannot be so set. Even in purely instrumental music
the possibility soon has its natural limits, whatever
the genius of the composer, and despite the undeniably
great effects that may be accomplished. Did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
not Beethoven himself, on overhearing his&mdash;how
many variations was it, on a theme?&mdash;exclaim: "Oh,
Beethoven, what an ass thou art!" There spoke the
great man! Nature will never be sacrificed to a
crotchet.</p>

<p>The design of this celebrated work was grand,
characteristic, worthy of its great designer; but the
execution we cannot feel corresponded. It seems to
us the A-B-C of reasoning, that a time <i>must</i> come
in the career of every man when his powers decay.
We speak, and rightly, of the records of his brain
as messages from the Infinite; but, nevertheless,
when those cells get enfeebled, that telegraph of
nervous tissue corrupted, the messages are no longer
mighty as of yore: Divine messages do not and will
not come, except through the mystically-operating
(for they also are divine) healthy physical mediums.
Psychology and physiology are inextricably blended,
if not one. Beethoven's faculties, then, it seems to
us, had already begun to decay&mdash;he was older than
other men at his years. He had been long deaf;
was almost broken down with worry and care; and,
probably, alas! trembled on the verge of incipient
insanity (were it not already incipient). He was no
longer rich in the fresh originality of his prime&mdash;in
the original freshness of his youth; he had, perhaps,
essentially written himself out (herein below Shakespeare).
He began to repeat himself, to theorise,
to <i>make</i> music. Did he not himself say, "I plan,
but when I sit down to perform, I find I have nothing
to write." There again spoke the truly great man,
honest to the last. He could, of course, never get
away from his individuality&mdash;get out of himself;
no man can. But even ideas now seemed to fail
him, and their absence is no compensation for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
new style of the old individual, let alone when that
is dubious.</p>

<p>To sum up. The Choral Symphony seems, at the
best, a grand but doubtful experiment. Its greatest,
its only inspired movement, is the adagio; and that,
heavenly as it is, interferes with the progress of the
work&mdash;with the scheme of it&mdash;as depicting doubt,
denial, and despair ("there shall be wailing and
gnashing of teeth"), to be followed by oil upon the
waters&mdash;by an uncontrollable outburst, sacred fury
almost, of joy, at the perception by man that he is
imperishable, part of the All; not only recipient of
joy here, but justified demander and mortgagee of it
hereafter; and joy of joy even at the high perception
that even if we personally are not immortal, we are
bubbles of the eternal sea, and that is immortal.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="Summing_Up" id="Summing_Up">
<span class="smcap">Summing Up.</span></a></h3>

<p>Finally, it is such thoughts as these, consciously or
unconsciously expressed, which stamp and distinguish
Beethoven's music as a whole, to which we now turn.
In his jubilation is the "fulness of joy"; in his
sadness the core of sorrow. He has "made the
passage from heaven to hell"; he has sounded the
gamut of sound. In his four great symphonies, the
one in D (the rushing forth and soaring up of youth,
Elterlein considers it); the Eroica, the C minor, and
the A major; in these four symphonies, to which the
soul's eye in predilection turns, which stand out
from all the rest; and in many of his other works&mdash;whose
soul is as great, but substance less&mdash;we see
Beethoven, probably the most glorious emotional
representative of man in history&mdash;not only in music,
but art, almost literature. He is thus the greatest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
phenomenon perhaps of modern times after Shakespeare.
Shakespeare over-tops him; but who else?
Not Dante&mdash;too fierce, and crude, and narrow (see
how blatant he is about Mahomet, and his annotator,
Professor Bianchi, ten times worse&mdash;he has the most
stupendously stupid note we ever read!) not Milton,
less rich and influential; not his own contemporary
and countryman, Goethe, whose Faust and Egmont
are in Beethoven's music rather than in his own
words, and who had not Beethoven's genial humanity,
world-wide breadth, heaven's-heart depth, and titanic
power. Only his Fatherland's philosophical giants,
methinks, can rank with him; and their influence and
effect are naturally limited. He thought in music&mdash;the
most delicious volumes of philosophy! thought
and feeling are presented to us in one&mdash;aye, and
painting too. <i>Apropos</i>, so also do we rank him above
the artists. The works of Apelles and Phidias are
gone; the very Parthenon is going. But his works
will last; and they mesmerise and master us with a
power which theirs never could do&mdash;theirs, and Angelo's,
and Raphael's; or Rubens, and Rembrandt,
and Turner. For music is the highest of the arts, as
being most the message of the Highest: and here is
the music of the highest of her messengers. Yes! for
only Handel (whom he so characteristically revered)
can match with him, and that only in power. In
originality, in richness, in depth (including intensity&mdash;glow),
in humanity, eminently in influence think
of Beethoven's sonatas spread over the world, besides
his quartets and symphonies, pyramidal models;
whereas Handel would hardly be known but for his
"Messiah," (and that chiefly in England); in a word,
in universality, and a certain mystical soul of meaning&mdash;sacred
mystery of insight and sorrow&mdash;within
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
him; in these he surpasses Handel&mdash;and all. Not
that he has exhausted music. No. Music was considered
exhausted before him; and even his music,
symphonies and sonatas alike, are of unequal quality
and merit individually as well as comparatively.
And not that all great music does not, more or less,
like his work&mdash;reveal (or shadow forth) what his
does; and instrumentation has made advances since
him; but he is the <i>ne plus ultra</i> as yet, though not,
indeed, without companions. For this is a law as
much morally or intellectually as physically. The
highest peaks in the Himalayas, Andes, and Alps,
are together; and here the appearances around me
preach the same truth. One summit is the special
manifestation of a general upheaval (we have already
given particular instances), and these take place at
periods. The musical upheaval (the tertiary deposit)
has taken place late. Primevally was the architectural
(least original, and slowest of all the arts&mdash;?),
then the sculptural, pictorial, and poetic; groups and
series, peaks and summits of masters, in all. With
revived art and literature came the quasi seraph,
Shakespeare; then science and music, contemporary
with the greatest movement in philosophy, and this
significantly&mdash;for nothing happens without import
and relation. Beethoven, it is true, set masses; but
he was essentially a Theist, if not Pantheist (unconscious
pantheism, we take it, is the soul of his music).
One worthy gentleman delivered himself of the following
lucubration <i>re</i> Beethoven's "Mount of
Olives":&mdash;"It is a fine work, <i>but</i> proves its author to
have been a Deist, and&mdash;" Oh, that "but"! I cry
you mercy, my fine particle; there is great virtue too
in a "but." We could not help smiling, and thinking
of "Poor God, with nobody to help him!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
</p>

<p>A highly curious and most instructive fact about
Beethoven is, that (as we before remarked, I think),
it is very difficult, if not impossible, to find his analogue.
In this individuality he is sublime. Hardly
any comparison satisfies us; neither Aiskulos, Homer,
Virgil, Dante, Milton, or Shakespeare, is exactly his
like. He has Dante's intensity, Milton's sublimity
(more organ-like than Dante's), and Shakespeare's
universality to a great extent&mdash;that is, his
humanity and quasi superhuman lyrical beauty
and dramatic power, but not his wonderful comic
genius (as far as we can judge from music, though
Beethoven's shows undoubted humour&mdash;which is part,
indeed, of humanity); his <i>characteristic</i>, seraphic
serenity, and infinity, wealth of creation, and inexhaustibility
to the last. Beethoven is a unique (as
Carlyle called Dickens) blending of these three (and
allied to Shakespeare most), <i>plus</i> his own great indispensable
self (for there is ever a new factor in every
new man). Neither can we quite match him with
any of the artists. He has the severity of Phidias&mdash;or
Praxiteles&mdash;who was famous for bronze, the
grandeur of Bruneleschi and Angelo, the grace and
feeling of Raffael and Canova, the mystic splendour of
Turner, and the unique originality, the powerful chiaroscuro
of Rembrandt. Indeed, his relationship to
the latter is curiously interesting. These words,
applied to Rembrandt, might be applied to Beethoven:&mdash;"His
advance from youth to age is marked,
if not by inexperience or feebleness, at all events by
successive and distinctive manners." "The product
of his art is startling; it is singular for individuality
of character, supreme in light, shade, and colour."
Beethoven, however, was not an "artist who took
what may be termed his daily constitutional walk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
through the lower types of nature;" rather he was a
Jove's eagle, a Gannymede on his pinions, winging
his unseen way through empyreans. Among the
artists of his own vocation he is likewise unique.
It is true, that as Guinicelli closely preceded Dante
(and may even be called his master&mdash;<i>Il Saggio</i> Dante
names him); as Tasso, and Ariosto, and Shakespeare,
and Milton, were a grand cluster in the Elizabethan
period, Corneille, Racine, and Voltaire later, Schiller,
Goethe, and Wieland, after; so Beethoven splendours in
what we have called the Orion's Belt of music, Haydn,
Mozart, and Beethoven; but, to slightly vary, he is
the red star in Orion, the Mont Blanc of the Alps;
neither is Handel, the great sun in the "constellation
Hercules" (to which our system is said to move), his
superior&mdash;or quite his equal.</p>

<p>Our persuasion of Beethoven's religious impressions
("he could be seldom got to speak about religion")
was derived rather from internal evidence: but here
is an explicit passage on the matter. We read in his
<i>Tagebuch</i>, 1816, underlined, and written out in his
own hand:&mdash;"<i>Aus der Indischen Literatur</i>: God is
immaterial, therefore unthinkable: (<i>geht über jeden
Begriff</i>: since he is invisible, he can have no form).
But, from what we can gather in his works, we may
conclude that He is almighty, all-knowing, and omnipresent."
The following (still more significant) he
wrote out in a <i>Quartblatt</i>, in large letters, had framed,
and kept before him on his writing-table. It was
taken from the temple of the Egyptian goddess,
Neith, at Sais:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. I Am what Is.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">2. I am all that is, was, will be. No mortal hath ever lifted my veil.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
<span class="i0">3. He is alone, self existent (<i>Er ist allein von ihm selbst</i>); and to this Unique all things owe their being.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the last sentence, we may observe, there is (as
usual) a contradiction with the first&mdash;a confusion
between theism and pantheism; for, if the great I Am
is all, all things cannot be said to owe their being to
him, but <i>are</i> him&mdash;fragmentary manifestations of
him.</p>

<p>A list of the books found in Beethoven's <i>Handbibliothek</i>,
are also, in some sort, a key to the man
(and his music). <i>Ecco!</i> Shakespeare; Goethe's
Poems, "Wilhelm Meister," and "Faust"; Schiller;
Tiedge's "Urania" (Beethoven's beautiful "An die
Hoffnung," Op. 32, is a setting of a song in that);
Seumes' and Matthison's Poems, and others; "Briefe
an Natalie über Gesang," von Nina d'Aubigny-Engelbrunner
(much esteemed, and recommended by
Beethoven); Klopstock; Zach; Werner; Herder
(Goethe's "Master"); Plato; Aristotle; Xenophon;
Plutarch; Euripides; Horace; Pliny; Quintilian
(these, I presume, translated&mdash;Dr. Nohl does not
say); Thomson (whose nature-painting made him
specially prized); and Ossian (Napoleon's favourite).</p>

<p>We read that against the words, often cited
too, of Carlyle, "Two things strike me dumb;
the moral law within us, and the starry heavens
over us"; he wrote&mdash;"<i>mit kräftigen Schriftzug</i>"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Kant.</span>
In his celebrated will, we read&mdash;"I
will seize Fate by the throat, quite bow me
down it never shall." In his Journal, 1816, we read,
"The grand mark of a great man; stedfastness in
unhappy circumstances." One of his remarks was
this:&mdash;"There is nothing higher than this&mdash;to get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
nearer to the Godhead than other men; and thence
diffuse its beams over mankind." Another noteworthy
observation was this:&mdash;"Celebrated artists
are always prejudiced (or pre-occupied); therefore,
their first works are the best, although they
germinated in obscurity."&mdash;(Nohl's "Life of Beethoven,"
vol. 3, p. 238). One of his most pregnant
remarks was the following:&mdash;"All real invention is
moral progress" (<i>Alle echte Erfindung ist moralisher
Fortschritt</i>).</p>

<p>Beethoven's music is so pregnant, that it is difficult
to sum up what it contains. As before stated, it is a
microcosm, both of man and the world: it especially
unrolls before us man (how he thinks, and feels, and
fights) as much as the powerful disquisitions of a
Kant or Hegel. It is representative, because so intensely
subjective; representative from himself outward&mdash;he
being not a narrowly but comprehensively
subjective soul; we find in it (very profoundly) his
own unsatisfied heart&mdash;type of how much in the
world! We find in it his unhappy life&mdash;type of still
more. We find in it his intense character, full of
sublime passion, and only more dear to us for its
faults. We find in it his infirmities&mdash;especially a
dark prophesy of <i>mens</i> <span class="smcap">in</span><i>sana in corpore insano</i>; but
we were spared that sad spectacle, by the "cruel-to-be-kind"
messenger of Providence. We find in it
the pure passionate love of Nature most concentrated
in the Teutonic nature&mdash;coruscating with mystic
sparks shooting from the heart on all sides outward.
We find in it at once the most intense lyrical and
dramatic power hitherto known. We find in it, alike,
gracious fancy and grand imagination. We find in it
humanity and humour. Moreover, we find in it the
grandest <i>objective</i> power of painting&mdash;heroic battles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
as well as with hope&mdash;on "our prison walls; far-reaching
landscapes and aurora"; together with a
subjective power and pre-eminence that is almost
awful in its majesty. We find in it the subtle and
the sublime&mdash;if it be not for sublime to be subtle.
Last, and lowest, we find in it unsettled faith&mdash;distracting
a soul of good, wearying and worrying his
great good heart, but not overcoming it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It could not bring him wholly under more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than loud south-westerns, rolling ridge on ridge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The buoy that rides at sea, and dips and springs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ever;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and herein is our Beethoven&mdash;he, too, a man of
sorrows, and acquainted with grief. <i>Ach!</i> Man
is that, most&mdash;most intensely representative. This is
the real reason why he so speaks to us, and shakes
us; why he so influenced his contemporaries and
followers. An age is represented by its greatest&mdash;that
is, by the richest in goodness and insight,
and these mutually represent each other; but you will
not find them in temple or tabernacle&mdash;except, indeed,
that not made by hands. You will find them where
you find their heart&mdash;(where a man's treasure is,
there is his heart also). Ask them what they think,
and feel. You will find that they consider all our
common <i>isms</i> and <i>alities</i> but as episodes&mdash;aye, and
brief ones&mdash;if not, more or less, unconscious insanities.
That, inevitably, as the world in its giant history
proceeded from Nothingism (for how many ages?) to
Fetishism&mdash;to Confuciusism&mdash;to Buddhism&mdash;to Jewism&mdash;to
Paganism (or Greek and Romanism)&mdash;to
Christianity; so common Christianity (the temporal,
dogmatic, superstitious, local, parochial), must also
proceed to something higher; which shall be at once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
outcome and all-compriser of the rest. Man has got
to realise his identity with the Imperishable (caring
little, if he must "soon be making head to go" from
this&mdash;has soon "notice to quit" this lodging&mdash;in the
cold ground); the absolute indestructibility of any
one manifestation of force&mdash;or rather fact of force&mdash;for
the manifestations change, and pass away. He
has got to learn to love goodness for its own sake
alone, and know that Conscience is God&mdash;<i>realising</i>
with the most lyric and scientific conviction that <i>every</i>
violation of right or law, moral even more inevitably
than physical&mdash;let every one search his own life and
conscience for the proof&mdash;is punished here without
or within&mdash;frequently, and most sublimely, subtly,
within. Finally, he has got to make this his faith
that&mdash;while clinging to the truly blessed hope of
everlasting life, which is the natural corollary of our
consciousness, as our dearest sheet-anchor; as the
sense that most makes us feel infinite; and as the
soul of beauty, or beautifying soul of all&mdash;so, nevertheless,
the practical immortality of right action (or of
goodness) perpetuating itself in what we do and say,
here and now&mdash;is our chief concern, the sole thing
essential; which we may supplement and consummate
by falling back on the tremendous realization
before expressed. If <i>we</i> are not immortal, we are
bubbles of the eternal sea of being, and <i>that</i> is&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Once again, then, let us repeat, such high belief,
more or less, is the <i>soul</i> of Beethoven's music (aye,
even in his masses), for the eternal speaks behind the
temporary, the mask; hence its specific gravity
(greatest of all), its infinite significance. He is the
morning star of this reformation, the breast-inflaming
dawn of a new heaven in a grander clime&mdash;new firmament
over New Jerusalem. Powdered-wigged Haydn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
and Mozart&mdash;powdered-wigged genius even, including
full-bottomed-wigged Handel&mdash;could not proclaim
such a creed;&mdash;almost, as it were, with thunder of
cannon. But Beethoven ushered in the nineteenth
century; he was the Napoleon of its better half&mdash;higher
life; and in due time and order followers and
apostles will succeed&mdash;have already arisen. The
symphony, especially the un-betitled be-programmed
symphony, is the purest manifestation of music,
whose eloquence is better than words&mdash;(space, too, is
silent); and the talk of sundry German professors,
&amp;c., about music "no longer playing a single part,"
coolly assuming, almost, the symphony to be an exploded
error, we are almost tempted to describe as
crotchety maundering or wordy wind, if not blatant
jargon. This superfluous pity for music standing
alone, also reminds us of "Poor God! with nobody
to help him!" No! the symphony will still be
penned by the tone-poet&mdash;intensely feeling and thinking,
lyrico-dramatic man. It will be broad as the
world, and have a soul of the highest. It will be the
grandest absolute expression of the best which we
see and are. But it will also be counterparted and
supplemented by the "Word-made-Flesh" in tone
(the Word is never so beautifully made Flesh as in
tone), as Thought is made Flesh in the Word. Religion
is the Heart of Art, whence all pulses and flows;
and composers will&mdash;at last&mdash;get sick of setting twaddle
and dogma, however venerable; and will celebrate
pure truth, old or new. In setting the Higher Utterance
of the past, they will reject the husk and keep
the kernel&mdash;that of eternal universal application; or
they will transfigure by ideal interpretation. In setting
the new, they will set lyrical expression of the
profound poet&mdash;the earnest words of the intense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
thinker, and not the jingle of the song-writer, the
farrago of the libretto-concocter. In a word, the
higher oratorio (as well as the higher drama), will
play its part; be the exponent&mdash;as the symphony
will be the expression&mdash;of the new man. This will
be the mightiest manifestation of music&mdash;universal
truth, profound feeling, transcendency, and humanity;
Shakespeare and Emerson (not Milton) in one; incarnate
in tone, published and borne aloft by Music and
the Human Voice; culminating in such apotheosis at
last!&mdash;after so many ages of stuttering, <i>singing</i> will
at length have reached to Highest Thought!</p>

Strauss (<i>not</i> the dance composer), in rather a cavilling spirit,
says this symphony describes the life of a hero. So it does, but
not in the external sense he uses it in, but in the internal; life,
means inner life. Or, again, the work celebrates heroism rather
than a hero.</p></div>
